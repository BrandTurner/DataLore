It is from that knowledge, and my collaboration with two Guardians \u2014 Hunter Uzoma Vale and the Warlock they call The Stoic \u2014 that the Zen Meteor was born.\n\nThis groundbreaking weapon uses electroencephalography to draw energy from the wielder's neural activity. It can even, if a certain threshold is met, convert that energy into matter to be used as concussive ammunition.\n\nOr, to be more precise \u2014 the more focused the wielder's mind, the more powerful the weapon.",

It's a place where you could go for thousands\u2014millions\u2014of miles without ever seeing another friendly face, and yet never once be able to stretch your legs.\n\nNow imagine: you're spelunking across an asteroid, or crawling through a half-collapsed ship that could be hundreds of years old. You won't see enemies coming, not in a tight corner like that. Won't hear 'em or smell 'em either, not in the void. But then you move, or they move, and there you both are.\n\nRifles, shotguns, they aren't gonna cut it. You don't have room to heft a barrel of that length. Don't have the arm room to throw a knife or a grenade either. But what you do have is a sidearm at your hip. Small enough for a fast draw, strong enough to save your life.\n\nThat's why the Queen sends out every last Corsair with a Vestian Dynasty sidearm at our hips. And Vestian Dynasty is what gets us home again too.",

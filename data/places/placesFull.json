His maps and outposts show the risen Exo roamed free from the Aral Seas to an eastern border known as Citan’s Ridge (Open Citan 01-A, Citan’s Ridge 01-A) before taking the Oath. There is no evidence of human enclaves or encampments within this area, nor survivors within the Cosmodrome walls, but extensive one-way audio recordings with an unknown entity survive (open Felwinter 9-C; open Rasputin 62-G; scan for possible links). A chance meeting with Lord Timur in the Mothyards led to Timur’s first reports on the promises of SIVA. Felwinter’s conscription into the ranks and the raising of the Iron Temple commenced shortly thereafter.</p>",

There is no evidence of human enclaves or encampments within this area, nor survivors within the Cosmodrome walls, but extensive one-way audio recordings with an unknown entity survive (open Felwinter 9-C; open Rasputin 62-G; scan for possible links). A chance meeting with Lord Timur in the Mothyards led to Timur’s first reports on the promises of SIVA.

To our ancestors it must have been a hammerblow - a glimpse beyond the horizon of expected possibility and into a realm of transcendent power.<br><br>\nThe Traveler kindled the Golden Age. But we built it. We remember this with pride, even after so much else has been lost. We settled our solar system and filled it with our work.<br><br>\nToday Cryptarchs and scholars work to distill the legends of the Golden Age into truth. We know that humans lived longer, flew further, and knew more. We know that countless ancient diseases and hatreds were extinguished forever. Human aspiration gives birth to vast engineering projects, sweeping social movements, and even new forms of life.<br><br>\nThe Golden Age was not without challenges. Sources speak of internal strife, philosophical rifts- particularly around questions of machine intelligence and 'mind forking' - and enduring scientific enigmas. But humanity and its machine children tackled these problems with pride, vigor, and a contagious sense of pluralist compassion.</p>",

Making a show of it all.<br><br>\nEveryone else was still. Quiet.<br><br>\nI tugged at my father's sleeve, but he just tightened his grip on my shoulder to the point pain. His way of letting me know that this was not the time.<br><br>\nI'd watched Jaren's every move over the past months, mapping his effortless gestures and slight, earned mannerisms. I'd never seen anything like him. He was something I couldn't comprehend, and yet I felt I understood all I needed the moment I'd seen him. He was more than us. Not better. Not superior. Just more.<br><br>\nI wanted father to stop what was happening. Looking back now, I realize that he didn't want to stop it. No one d id.<br><br>\nAs Loken belittled Jaren Ward, taunted him, enumerated his crimes and sins, my eyes were stuck on Jaren's pistol, fixed to his hip. His steady hand resting calmly on his belt.<br><br>\nI remembered the pistol's weight. Effortless. And my concern faded. I understood.<br><br>\n\"This is our town! My town!\" Loken was shouting now. He was going to make a show of Jaren - teach the people of Palamon a lesson in obedience.<br><br>\nJaren spoke: clear, calm. \"Not anymore.\"<br><br>\nLoken laughed dismissively. He had nine guns on his side. \"Those gonna be your last words then, boy?\"<br><br>\nThe movement was a flash: quick as chain lightning. Jaren Ward spoke as he moved. \"Yours. Not mine.\"<br><br>\nSmoke trailed from Jaren's revolver.<br><br>\nLoken hit the ground. A dark hole in his forehead. Eyes staring into eternity.<br><br>\nJaren stared down the nine guns trained on him. One by one, they lowered their aim. And the rest of my life began - where, in a few short years, so many others would be ended.</p>",

He had nine guns on his side. \"Those gonna be your last words then, boy?\"<br><br>\nThe movement was a flash: quick as chain lightning. Jaren Ward spoke as he moved. \"Yours. Not mine.\"<br><br>\nSmoke trailed from Jaren's revolver.<br><br>\nLoken hit the ground. A dark hole in his forehead. Eyes staring into eternity.<br><br>\nJaren stared down the nine guns trained on him. One by one, they lowered their aim.

They might have been worms, if worms had scales and teeth and moved more quickly than a man could run.<br><br>\nJun died first. And then Luli. Bad deaths.

The sleep that isn’t sleep.<br><br>\nBut then everything on the Moon is named for what it’s not.

Not after seeing those worms.<br><br>\nBut here now, at the bottom I have found the other side of the nightmare. Like waking from a dream only to realize you were still asleep. Perhaps my oxygen is getting low. Yes, I can see it is. Hypoxia already setting in. The thing before me is like myself—partly alive, and partly not. An ossified afterbirth. A pulsating tumor.<br><br>\nIt lays in a crater of its own making. Dark and jagged. So here I’ll sit, and lay me down. I see a doorway, and within, the death-white egg cases of nightmares yet to come.<br><br>\nAnd glad I am to miss it.</p>",

We will not return.<br><br>\nI only hope now that my foolish charge will serve as a record of warning.

With Father, every question was vast, particularly those that looked simple. And simple questions deserved as much insight and wisdom as could be brought to bear.<br><br>\nWith that in mind, I said nothing.<br><br>\nWhy would my father hate maps?<br><br>\nOne of his collaborators came into the office. Father didn’t have employees. Or assistants. And for that matter, he didn’t have heroes either. Every person, living or lost, was a collaborator, and that included his children.<br><br>\n“Clovis,” said the visitor.<br><br>\nFather heard the woman, but he was watching me.<br><br>\nThe woman was pretty, and I was sixteen. So I looked at her, smiling enough for both of us. And she threw an appreciative wink my way as she described test results from the last five billion runs of our AI Initiative.<br><br>\nOut on the Martian desert, my father and picked collaborators were building housing too cold for this universe and too swift to be real.<br><br>\nAnd I was a sixteen year-old boy smiling at a pretty woman.<br><br>\nMy father thanked her for the update, and she left.<br><br>\nJust as I feared, he never looked away from me.<br><br>\n“I don’t know why you hate maps,” I admitted.<br><br>\nWith Father, ignorance was never the worst crime. What was awful was pretending to have insight and wisdom where neither existed.<br><br>\n“Maps end,” he said.<br><br>\nI nodded, just a little.<br><br>\n“Maps insist on having borders and edges or the table falls away. Which isn’t the way the universe works.”<br><br>\n“It doesn’t, no,” I agreed.<br><br>\nThen he asked me, “So how does the universe work?”<br><br>\nI pretended to take my time, considering various smart answers. But I ended up using my first impulse.<br><br>\n“Effortlessly,” I said.<br><br>\nHe laughed. Which wasn’t uncommon for my father, but it was heartening to hear just then.<br><br>\n“What else can you tell me?” he asked.<br><br>\n“The universe is infinite and probably in multiple ways,” I said. Then I listed a few examples: The census of stars, the Many-Worlds principle in quantum mechanics, and the endless measure of tiny realms hiding inside every grain of Martian sand.<br><br>\nFather nodded.<br><br>\nThe smile died.<br><br>\nThen he said something ominous. Although I didn’t appreciate it at the time.<br><br>\n“The universe is someone’s map,” he said.<br><br>\n“Is it?” I muttered.<br><br>\n“Yes, oh yes. And what we’re doing here... we’re reaching beyond the boundaries, out into the unknown. And we pull back new colors to put on this map that can never, ever let itself be finished.”<br><br>\nI nodded, smiling like the good son.<br><br>\nBut I was sixteen, and my thoughts were mostly about the pretty woman who had winked at me.</p>",

With Father, every question was vast, particularly those that looked simple. And simple questions deserved as much insight and wisdom as could be brought to bear.<br><br>\nWith that in mind, I said nothing.<br><br>\nWhy would my father hate maps?<br><br>\nOne of his collaborators came into the office. Father didn’t have employees. Or assistants. And for that matter, he didn’t have heroes either. Every person, living or lost, was a collaborator, and that included his children.<br><br>\n“Clovis,” said the visitor.<br><br>\nFather heard the woman, but he was watching me.<br><br>\nThe woman was pretty, and I was sixteen. So I looked at her, smiling enough for both of us. And she threw an appreciative wink my way as she described test results from the last five billion runs of our AI Initiative.<br><br>\nOut on the Martian desert, my father and picked collaborators were building housing too cold for this universe and too swift to be real.<br><br>\nAnd I was a sixteen year-old boy smiling at a pretty woman.<br><br>\nMy father thanked her for the update, and she left.<br><br>\nJust as I feared, he never looked away from me.<br><br>\n“I don’t know why you hate maps,” I admitted.<br><br>\nWith Father, ignorance was never the worst crime. What was awful was pretending to have insight and wisdom where neither existed.<br><br>\n“Maps end,” he said.<br><br>\nI nodded, just a little.<br><br>\n“Maps insist on having borders and edges or the table falls away. Which isn’t the way the universe works.”<br><br>\n“It doesn’t, no,” I agreed.<br><br>\nThen he asked me, “So how does the universe work?”<br><br>\nI pretended to take my time, considering various smart answers. But I ended up using my first impulse.<br><br>\n“Effortlessly,” I said.<br><br>\nHe laughed. Which wasn’t uncommon for my father, but it was heartening to hear just then.<br><br>\n“What else can you tell me?” he asked.<br><br>\n“The universe is infinite and probably in multiple ways,” I said. Then I listed a few examples: The census of stars, the Many-Worlds principle in quantum mechanics, and the endless measure of tiny realms hiding inside every grain of Martian sand.<br><br>\nFather nodded.<br><br>\nThe smile died.<br><br>\nThen he said something ominous. Although I didn’t appreciate it at the time.<br><br>\n“The universe is someone’s map,” he said.<br><br>\n“Is it?” I muttered.<br><br>\n“Yes, oh yes. And what we’re doing here... we’re reaching beyond the boundaries, out into the unknown. And we pull back new colors to put on this map that can never, ever let itself be finished.”<br><br>\nI nodded, smiling like the good son.<br><br>\nBut I was sixteen, and my thoughts were mostly about the pretty woman who had winked at me.</p>",

Developed in these laboratories built to my specifications, by my handpicked team, these nanites will double, triple, maybe even quadruple construction rates, reduce colonist casualties, and serve us in our spread across the system, then across the stars.

Okay, okay, I'll tell the story about the Prison of Elders...<br><br>\nThe Awoken will tell you that a long time ago the Queen conquered the House of Wolves. What they won't say, because they are very serious important people, is that the House of Wolves did a lot of the job for them. After the Queen killed the Wolf Kell, the Fallen started competing for the throne. One of the first battles was called the Eos Clash and I wasn't anywhere near it, but I'm pretty sure I'm not making this up. A Fallen named Skolas wiped out one of his rivals in the Eos Clash. But the battle cost him so much he got to thinking: if the Reef killed my boss, and gave me a chance at the throne, maybe I can use the Reef to kill all my rivals too!<br><br>\nPretty good, right? When they told me I had to be a Vanguard I went to ask some Fallen how I could get out of it, but they just told me to kill all my friends and then myself. Anyway.<br><br>\nEveryone involved in the civil war started trying to play their rivals against each other, and the Awoken too. No one wanted to become so strong that they'd be a target. No one wanted to bleed their own forces dry doing someone else's dirty work. Cutthroat politics! And who's the best at cutthroat politics? That's right, her Majesty, the Queen of the Reef.<br><br>\nAt the end of the wars, the Queen had played her way into the strongest position, and she had a collection of Fallen nobility and servitors she thought might be useful to her. Of course she thought so! She'd just used them against each other and won absolute control of the Reef, the Belt, and the House of Wolves. She wasn't about to just toss away her playing pieces.<br><br>\nShe kept them frozen in her prison, the Prison of Elders, and she gave the keys to that prison to my buddy Variks, a Fallen who showed her loyalty. The Prison of Elders is a really curious thing. It holds creatures of enormous power. Not just Wolf nobility— all kinds of beasts, captured by Corsair expeditions or lured in by the Queen. And it holds them well. The Queen, she can do things I don't understand. There's a power behind her, or in her, that values that Prison.<br><br>\nBut I hear there's been a few prison breaks. Some old Kell got the old House of Wolves back together.<br><br>\nNow, she's started to wake up her captives. Variks is inviting Guardians out to the Reef to do battle with them in an arena—show valor, earn rewards. It's been their Crucible. Maybe the Queen wants her collection thinned out. Maybe the Queen wants Guardians in the Reef, to deter more unrest. Maybe the Queen wants intelligence on how her prizes fight.<br><br>\nMaybe she wants intelligence on how WE fight.<br><br>\nWhatever happens— I want you to remember that she knows, more than anyone else I've met, how to set one foe against another.</p>",

Beltrik the Veiled [HVT R3] and loyal spaceborne elements have been localized to 19 Fortuna. Beltrik is chief Wolf strategist. Corsair recon confirms that HVT R3 ships are resupplying ether and performing high-tempo logistical operations. Recon elements and COLLABINT sources agree that Beltrik will roll one ship at a time into the resupply pocket while holding all other assets to screen.<br><br>\n2. TF 4.1 will attack. Targets are HVT R3 spaceborne assets. Objective is annihilation of spaceborne assets and capture/nullification of HVT R3. Designate targets VEIL HAND.<br><br>\n2a. Due to history of violence between PLDN CMD TF 4.1 and HVT R3, particularly Battle of False Tidings/Hildian Campaign, Beltrik expects TF 4.1 to engage his screen directly. We will exploit this expectation. Fragment orders follow.<br><br>\n3. PETRA VENJ will detach select warships and air wing elements to form TF 4.2 MASS LENS. TF 4.2 is directed to engage VEIL HAND screen elements with skirmishers. TF 4.2 will deny main battle while pinning down VEIL HAND forces at 19 Fortuna. TF 4.2 will receive missile and torpedo assets to force VEIL HAND into maintaining tight mutual CIWS/ESM support.<br><br>\n3a. Decisive engagement with VEIL HAND in 4.2 MASS LENS AO is forbidden until GO CONTINGENCY satisfied. Prioritize FORCECON.<br><br>\n4. Remaining TF 4.1 will maneuver immediately to rendezvous with 687 Tinette. Tinette is on close approach with 19 Fortuna. TF 4.1 frigates and fighters will perform recon denial against VEIL HAND scouts.<br><br>\n4a. Upon rendezvous with 687 Tinette, TF 4.1 will deploy CARYBDIS. ***This is a CARYBDIS RELEASE (MAJESTY DIRECT)!***. TF 4.1 will maneuver in Tinette's shadow as it retrajectorizes for intercept.<br><br>\n5. GO CONTINGENCY: Upon collision of 687 Tinette and 19 Fortuna TF 4.1 and TF 4.2 will IMMEDIATELY close for decisive engagement. VEIL HAND C4I will be critically degraded and all targets will be maneuvering away from mutual support. Skirmishers and air wing will provide TARCAP and destroy VEIL HAND light warships as they attempt to reform. EWAR assets will isolate hostile heavy warships from C4I and spoof bad datalinks. Main combatants will cripple VEIL HAND heavy warships and board where opportune.<br><br>\n6. NO HARBINGER SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE.<br><br>\n7. Good luck.

Okay, okay, I'll tell the story about the Prison of Elders...<br><br>\nThe Awoken will tell you that a long time ago the Queen conquered the House of Wolves. What they won't say, because they are very serious important people, is that the House of Wolves did a lot of the job for them. After the Queen killed the Wolf Kell, the Fallen started competing for the throne. One of the first battles was called the Eos Clash and I wasn't anywhere near it, but I'm pretty sure I'm not making this up. A Fallen named Skolas wiped out one of his rivals in the Eos Clash. But the battle cost him so much he got to thinking: if the Reef killed my boss, and gave me a chance at the throne, maybe I can use the Reef to kill all my rivals too!<br><br>\nPretty good, right? When they told me I had to be a Vanguard I went to ask some Fallen how I could get out of it, but they just told me to kill all my friends and then myself. Anyway.<br><br>\nEveryone involved in the civil war started trying to play their rivals against each other, and the Awoken too. No one wanted to become so strong that they'd be a target. No one wanted to bleed their own forces dry doing someone else's dirty work. Cutthroat politics! And who's the best at cutthroat politics? That's right, her Majesty, the Queen of the Reef.<br><br>\nAt the end of the wars, the Queen had played her way into the strongest position, and she had a collection of Fallen nobility and servitors she thought might be useful to her. Of course she thought so! She'd just used them against each other and won absolute control of the Reef, the Belt, and the House of Wolves. She wasn't about to just toss away her playing pieces.<br><br>\nShe kept them frozen in her prison, the Prison of Elders, and she gave the keys to that prison to my buddy Variks, a Fallen who showed her loyalty. The Prison of Elders is a really curious thing. It holds creatures of enormous power. Not just Wolf nobility— all kinds of beasts, captured by Corsair expeditions or lured in by the Queen. And it holds them well. The Queen, she can do things I don't understand. There's a power behind her, or in her, that values that Prison.<br><br>\nBut I hear there's been a few prison breaks. Some old Kell got the old House of Wolves back together.<br><br>\nNow, she's started to wake up her captives. Variks is inviting Guardians out to the Reef to do battle with them in an arena—show valor, earn rewards. It's been their Crucible. Maybe the Queen wants her collection thinned out. Maybe the Queen wants Guardians in the Reef, to deter more unrest. Maybe the Queen wants intelligence on how her prizes fight.<br><br>\nMaybe she wants intelligence on how WE fight.<br><br>\nWhatever happens— I want you to remember that she knows, more than anyone else I've met, how to set one foe against another.</p>",

Beltrik the Veiled [HVT R3] and loyal spaceborne elements have been localized to 19 Fortuna. Beltrik is chief Wolf strategist. Corsair recon confirms that HVT R3 ships are resupplying ether and performing high-tempo logistical operations. Recon elements and COLLABINT sources agree that Beltrik will roll one ship at a time into the resupply pocket while holding all other assets to screen.<br><br>\n2. TF 4.1 will attack. Targets are HVT R3 spaceborne assets. Objective is annihilation of spaceborne assets and capture/nullification of HVT R3. Designate targets VEIL HAND.<br><br>\n2a. Due to history of violence between PLDN CMD TF 4.1 and HVT R3, particularly Battle of False Tidings/Hildian Campaign, Beltrik expects TF 4.1 to engage his screen directly. We will exploit this expectation. Fragment orders follow.<br><br>\n3. PETRA VENJ will detach select warships and air wing elements to form TF 4.2 MASS LENS. TF 4.2 is directed to engage VEIL HAND screen elements with skirmishers. TF 4.2 will deny main battle while pinning down VEIL HAND forces at 19 Fortuna. TF 4.2 will receive missile and torpedo assets to force VEIL HAND into maintaining tight mutual CIWS/ESM support.<br><br>\n3a. Decisive engagement with VEIL HAND in 4.2 MASS LENS AO is forbidden until GO CONTINGENCY satisfied. Prioritize FORCECON.<br><br>\n4. Remaining TF 4.1 will maneuver immediately to rendezvous with 687 Tinette. Tinette is on close approach with 19 Fortuna. TF 4.1 frigates and fighters will perform recon denial against VEIL HAND scouts.<br><br>\n4a. Upon rendezvous with 687 Tinette, TF 4.1 will deploy CARYBDIS. ***This is a CARYBDIS RELEASE (MAJESTY DIRECT)!***. TF 4.1 will maneuver in Tinette's shadow as it retrajectorizes for intercept.<br><br>\n5. GO CONTINGENCY: Upon collision of 687 Tinette and 19 Fortuna TF 4.1 and TF 4.2 will IMMEDIATELY close for decisive engagement. VEIL HAND C4I will be critically degraded and all targets will be maneuvering away from mutual support. Skirmishers and air wing will provide TARCAP and destroy VEIL HAND light warships as they attempt to reform. EWAR assets will isolate hostile heavy warships from C4I and spoof bad datalinks. Main combatants will cripple VEIL HAND heavy warships and board where opportune.<br><br>\n6. NO HARBINGER SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE.<br><br>\n7. Good luck.

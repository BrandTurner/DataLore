Scars marred his armor, and his sidearm lay in the dust. He didn't need it, now. The battle was over.<br><br>\nThis had been a mining outpost, once. A few buildings and a transport. Nestled amid a small forest, it had been like a precious jewel set atop the dull crown of the wildlands.<br><br>\nNow there was almost nothing left. The warrior began to walk slowly down into the valley. He pulled his helm from his head and let it drop with a muted thud into the ash. Of the forest, only stumps remained. Of the small village there was no trace; the buildings reduced to splinters. Here and there you could see dull gray signs of inhabitation.<br><br>\nAt the bottom of the valley, Radegast came to the source of the ash, death, and violence. The Light-bearers were laid out in a row, simple cloth covering their armored and robed forms. There were five of them, and they had been lined up beneath the melted girders of the settlement's great hall. <br><br>\nThese warlords had terrorized this part of the wilds for years. Hundreds had died at their hands. <br><br>\nRadegast turned as his companions crossed the valley floor to join him. They had been policing the dead, finding a fitting end for the settlers and miners of the outpost. Jolder came with a steady glide, energy and fire. Saladin, calm and slow, the weight of the dead on his shoulders. In formation behind them stepped Perun, her boots barely leaving a trace as she walked. They gathered before him.<br><br>\n\"Never again.\" He intoned the words quietly. The others stood as battle-scarred statues. <br><br>\n\"We ride against despots and warlords. We hide in these enclaves, hoping that other Light-bearers will not find us. We fear each other.\" He shook his head, his fists clenched. <br><br>\n\"And we should not. We are stronger, together. We are mighty, together. All we have to fear is... this.\" He pointed down at the dead warlords. \"Giving in. Allowing the power of the Light to blind us to what we truly are.\"<br><br>\nIt was Perun, of course, who asked the question. \"What are we?\" No judgment. No reproach. <br><br>\nStill, Radegast could feel their doubt. He turned upwards, and his eyes settled on the massive span that supported the hall. His eyes shone as he turned back to his fellows.<br><br>\n\"We will be what the people need us to be. We will be guardians. We will be protectors. We will hold the last of us together.\"<br><br>\nHis voice rang out across the still valley. \"Our days of hiding are ended. Say it now, each of you. Who among the other bearers do you trust? Who can be counted on to ride with us?\"<br><br>\n\"Bretomart,\u201d said Jolder.<br><br>\n\"Deidris,\" said Perun.<br><br>\n\"I trust only you, Radegast,\" said Saladin, and their leader scowled in response.<br><br>\n\"What are you saying? What are we?\" Perun asked again.<br><br>\nRadegast smiled. \"We will gather those you trust. We will not wait for this\"\u2014he gestured around him\u2014 \"to force our hand. We will ride against those that would use the Light against our own. Humanity must have protectors. Like the knights of old.\"<br><br>\nAround them, the dust swirled in the air. Shafts of sunlight coalesced in long slanted bars as the sun dipped towards the horizon. <br><br>\n\"Are you with me? Will you stand with me\u2014 as Iron Lords?\"<br><br>\nIn the waning light, their answers rang like thunder on the air.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800410_410fd5973a20619e77af51e095a6b39e.jpg"], "image_name": ["Lord Radegast"], "filename": ["800410_410fd5973a20619e77af51e095a6b39e.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800410_410fd5973a20619e77af51e095a6b39e.jpg", "path": "full/de3be20d72b3e9c5962cbf12776f07a940881182.jpg", "checksum": "6a93fcc5119f66bd464f30a842b3f915"}]},

Seems... too easy. I were Rience, I'd be thinking about poison, neurojammers...

A polished obsidian table rested heavily between them.<br><br>\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d have the courage to come back here,\u201d said the Warlord.<br><br>\n\u201cSituational awareness. Not courage. I go where I can do the most good. Thank you for seeing me.\u201d Felwinter\u2019s voice sounded as hollow as his helmet. Citan wanted to knock it clean off the Iron Lord\u2019s bony shoulders. He could do it with a single punch.<br><br>\n\u201cAs I recall, you used to have a throne on that Light-forsaken peak, \u2018til you joined up with the wolves. You\u2019re the only Warlord I know who held an entire mountain.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cFelwinter Peak.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNo one ever calls it that.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThe Iron Lords do. Though they did ask me to take that throne down.\u201d<br><br>\nCitan\u2019s laugh shook the room. \u201cHow is losing territory ever a good thing for a Warlord?\u201d Felwinter folded his hands atop the table. Underneath it, Citan made two fists, a crescent of Light flickering between them.<br><br>\n\u201cJoin us and find out,\u201d said the Iron Lord. \u201cTurn your sector over to us. You can still patrol it, of course.\u201d<br><br>\nCitan\u2019s voice lowered. \u201cOf course. You know I\u2019ll refuse.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll put you down, and take your territory by force. Over and over again if we have to.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI invite you to my home after you abandon us, and you come to threaten me?\u201d The Warlord stood, towering over Felwinter.<br><br>\n\u201cTo broker peace.\u201d Citan thought that even the voice behind the helmet didn\u2019t believe what it said. The floor shuddered as the Warlord upended the massive table with one hand. It smashed into the opposite wall, as tendrils of Void Light passed through it and coalesced into Felwinter\u2019s leaping form.<br><br>\nCitan had seen this parlor trick before, and judged that he could hammer the Iron Lord out of the air\u2014<br><br>\nBut Felwinter\u2019s momentum continued into a knee-lift that smashed into Citan\u2019s head as the larger man reared back to strike. The Warlord fell, the front of his helm shattering. Felwinter landed next to Citan\u2019s prone body.<br><br>\n\u201cLady Jolder taught me that. I can\u2019t say the Iron Lords haven\u2019t done me any favors,\u201d the voice intoned. <br><br>\n\u201cYou know we\u2019ll burn the world down before we let the Iron Lords rule it,\u201d the larger man gasped, breathing out of his mouth, his face a bloody mess.

But they\u2019re going to change the world; no one can stop them,\u201d Felwinter said quietly to the corpse. He parted his coat and drew a bronze shotgun. \u201cWill it be for the better? I don\u2019t know. But they mean to end the fighting, so I don\u2019t have to sleep with my back to the wall every night, Light in my hand. And that\u2019s not nothing.\u201d<br><br>\nHe paused, as if waiting for something.<br><br>\n\u201cNormally, this is where I ask you to reconsider. Tell you that you should come with me. See how powerful your Light can become. But I know you, Citan. What you do with the land you take, with its people. The other Lords\u2014especially Saladin\u2014might let you walk away. I\u2019m not going to give them the chance.\u201d<br><br>\nCitan\u2019s Ghost sparked into view from above, bringing its eye to bear on its fallen charge.

Lord Segoth knows that.\u201d<br><br>\nIn answer, Perun pointed into the valley. A red light had appeared.<br><br>\nThe mayor let out a wail. \"Segoth will kill us all. Or worse, he'll leave us to the Fallen.\"<br><br>\nPerun shook her head. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d <br><br>\nThe mayor looked at Perun and the two Titans standing on her other side.

So he takes the west road, 'cause it's the most visible, and the most direct.\"<br><br>\nRadegast frowned. \"Then it's time to show Segoth that his tyranny will end.\"<br><br>\n\"Not just Segoth,\" said Perun. She jerked a thumb toward the ruins behind her. Watchful faces poked out of windows and around tarps. \"We gotta show them.\"<br><br>\nThe three of them picked up large, rough-hewn metal shields. Behind their shields, each held a worn rifle, wrapped with cloth and chain mail.<br><br>\nThe Pike-riders' faces were now visible through early morning gloom.

Perun, Radegast, and Saladin slid backwards on the dusty path. But they dug in their heels, and the shields held. <br><br>\n\"Return fire!\"<br><br>\nTrapped in the narrow path, Segoth and his warriors fell one by one. <br><br>\nPerun, Radegast, and Saladin reloaded and then Segoth was up again, his glowing Ghost at his shoulder. He fired wildly, and a bullet struck Radegast in the head. <br><br>\n\"Got him!\" Perun shouted as Radegast collapsed.<br><br>\n\"Covering you!\" Saladin returned. <br><br>\nPerun, Radegast, and Saladin died many more times than any one of Segoth's men. But any time one of them fell, another would cover them until they staggered to their feet again. The shield wall held. The three gave no ground. <br><br>\nFinally, his robes singed and ragged, Segoth signaled a retreat. <br><br>\n\u201cIron Wolves!\u201d he shouted as his warriors scattered and a cheer went up from the people in the silver ruins. \u201cI will slaughter everyone who has ever sheltered you!\"<br><br>\nIn answer, Perun shot him again.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800411_c6a1a7a3af9ddb3eb520c6bf9e81de78.jpg"], "image_name": ["Lady Perun"], "filename": ["800411_c6a1a7a3af9ddb3eb520c6bf9e81de78.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800411_c6a1a7a3af9ddb3eb520c6bf9e81de78.jpg", "path": "full/47c3f038ab70e295e47e9997f83156726c819713.jpg", "checksum": "7c37de30905c211e5754dc7e9e02895d"}]},

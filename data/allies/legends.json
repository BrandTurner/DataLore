He falls on all four hands, his mighty armor thundering against itself.<br><br>\nHis House of Wolves is enslaved! His people have been played! And it was his hubris, his would-be cunning that did it! While the other Houses fought for their future on Earth, throwing themselves at the Great Machine, Skolas wasted his people in games of betrayal and ambition.

Forgive me.\"<br><br>\nFrom beneath its hood, tiny fingers of shadow probe the air.<br><br>\nSkolas rises up to smash it, to show his strength, because the alternative to violence is waiting for violence to come from a universe that has neither respect nor compassion. But he checks himself. His ambitions have brought him here, to this cell in this strange place... only it's not so strange, is it? It's the hold of a Ketch. \"The Queen,\" he says to the thing. \"You work for the Queen.\"<br><br>\n\"The Nine made me aware of my purpose,\" the creature says. \"If am here, then it is because the Queen sent you to the Nine, and they wish you sent back.\"<br><br>\n\"I will do no one else's work.\" Skolas has been a pawn long enough. A Dreg told him, once, that she would play in a game as long as the game made sense. Nothing makes sense now except the thought of Variks' throat shattering in his fists. Variks! Variks the utterly disloyal, Variks who should be welded into a Ketch's prow atom by atom and left there as a figurehead to burn away.<br><br>\n\"I am comfortable,\" the creature with the moving face says. \"A part of me wants to go somewhere warm.

No. It cannot change the past. Only the future. Only the chance that his people might one day know themselves as more than pirates and scavengers.<br><br>\nHe should never have tried to be Kell of Wolves. He should have tried to be Kell of everything. Everything wants to kill his people, the machines and the militants and the green-eyed Hive. The dead soldiers that hoard the Great Machine and come out crusading to wipe all hope away.<br><br>\n\"The ship will be yours,\" the creature says. It hunches over itself as if burdened by its own shape. \"If you speak, you will be heard. I will go now. You are free.\"<br><br>\nHe tries to follow it. He fails. Somehow it is gone.

The shadow of Light grew darker. This, humanity\u2019s last oasis, slowly fading to a mirage.<br><br>\nGreat, powerful men and women, The Risen, stood at the Factions\u2019 sides. Protection.

Beneath it the Vandal\u2019s neck gave; a hiss of ether burst free before dissipating.<br><br>\nRezyl turned. Three Dregs charged. Their Captain raised his shock blade high, unleashing a battle cry to fuel their courage.<br><br>\nFocused fire spit from the muzzle of Rezyl\u2019s full-auto. The Dregs fell.<br><br>\nTo the Captain, Rezyl was a trophy that would buy unmatched respect among his Devil brothers.<br><br>\nTo Rezyl, the Captain was already an afterthought. As ether leaked from the pirate\u2019s broken body with each blow of Rezyl\u2019s heavy fists, Rezyl\u2019s attention had shifted to the unknown, but inevitable, battles to follow.<br><br>\nThis was the state of things; conflict as common as breath.<br><br>\n\u2014 The Tescan Valley Encounter \u2014<br><br>\nA Ketch with unfamiliar markings hung low between two peaks. A rare sight. Fallen flagships weren\u2019t known to linger so close to the surface, preferring constant motion, like sharks on the hunt.<br><br>\nSkiffs circled below the Ketch as their crews prepared to plunder any treasures the facility held.<br><br>\nRezyl leveled his rocket launcher. A digital ping signaled a lock, and a trail of smoke shot toward the lead Skiff.<br><br>\nTwo more rockets followed in rapid succession.<br><br>\nThe lead Skiff took two hits, lurched and retreated back toward the Ketch above.<br><br>\nThe third rocket caught a trailing Skiff as the craft turned to engage its attackers.<br><br>\nRezyl looked back. \u201cGo.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take a Ketch alone,\u201d Hassa laughed.<br><br>\n\u201cThe ship isn\u2019t my target,\u201d Rezyl had a plan. Hassa hated Rezyl\u2019s plans with equal parts envy and concern.<br><br>\n\u201cLead the Skiffs away,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet\u2014 \u201d<br><br>\n\u201cCan\u2019t meet if you\u2019re dead,\u201d Tover shot back.<br><br>\nRezyl smiled beneath his helm, \u201cGo.\u201d<br><br>\nHassa and Tover throttled their Sparrows and disappeared into the heavy woods. Rezyl watched from cover as the Skiffs gave chase.<br><br>\nThe Fallen below had taken defensive positions. The rocket attack caught them off guard but they were ready now, and there were more of them than he had time to count.<br><br>\nRezyl raced down the slope, weaving between the thick growth of brush and pine, on a direct path for the Fallen clustered at the mountain\u2019s base, his Ghost at his side.<br><br>\n\u201cI need you to hang back.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cUhhh...\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cTrust me.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAlways have.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHow quick can you light my spark?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou expect to die?

Eager Dregs rushed and were met with death as Rezyl marched forward.<br><br>\nA massive blast cratered the ground a few feet from the Titan. The Ketch had turned its guns on Rezyl.<br><br>\nAnother blast impacted to Rezyl\u2019s left and he stumbled. A third exploded directly in his path...<br><br>\n...and Rezyl fell.<br><br>\nFrom the treeline, his Ghost watched as the Fallen celebrated and a Skiff drifted down from the Ketch above.<br><br>\nThe circle around Rezyl\u2019s body parted and the imposing figure of their Kell stepped forward to admire his prize.<br><br>\nThe chittering excitement quieted to a steady drone as the Kell lifted Rezyl\u2019s limp body by the neck.<br><br>\nA chorus rose among the crew, growing louder as the Kell hefted Rezyl over his head for all to see.<br><br>\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost darted low through the crowd. He didn\u2019t like Rezyl\u2019s plan, but now he understood it.<br><br>\nDistracted by their Kell\u2019s triumph, the Ghost\u2019s presence went unnoticed until a beam of light swept over Rezyl\u2019s body.<br><br>\nThe mood shifted instantly, cheers turning to ravenous shouts.<br><br>\nThe Kell\u2019s gaze fell to the Ghost as the beam faded.<br><br>\nThe circle began to collapse \u2014 the Fallen set to pounce.<br><br>\nAs the Kell moved to toss Rezyl aside, cold steel met the underside of the alien marauder\u2019s jaw, followed by a red flash as Rezyl pulled his cannon\u2019s trigger.<br><br>\nEther spewed in an angry geyser and the Kell\u2019s grip loosened. Rezyl hit the ground and unloaded five more rounds into the Fallen leader\u2019s torso. The monster dropped.<br><br>\nFrenzied, the Kell\u2019s crew closed in like a flood.<br><br>\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost lifted above the fray, frantic, \u201cNow! Now! Now!\u201d<br><br>\nIn one motion, Rezyl rose from a crouch, his fists clenched and raised high as a storm of Arc Light built within him, his full might raining down on the Kell\u2019s chest. The shockwave of Rezyl\u2019s attack hit like a meteor, shattering <br>\nthe Kell\u2019s body and any Fallen within the Havoc storm\u2019s radius.<br><br>\nThe remaining Fallen staggered, knocked back and dazed.<br><br>\nRezyl triggered his Sparrow.<br><br>\nHis Ghost flew to his side, \u201cWe leaving?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBefore that Ketch opens up on us.\u201d<br><br>\nRezyl punched the throttle as the Fallen crew opened fire.<br><br>\n\u201cLet\u2019s never do that again,\u201d his Ghost pleaded.<br><br>\nRezyl didn\u2019t have to reply. If war was a constant, \u201cnever\u201d was just an illusion. <br><br>\n\u2014 In Defense of North Channel \u2014<br><br>\nWinds from the south caught the smoke and began to clear the thick air.<br><br>\nSlowly, the citizens of the small, snow-covered settlement came out from their hiding places.<br><br>\nRezyl surveyed their faces \u2014 each weary, but flecked with hope. <br><br>\nLiving in the wilds was all they had known. Surviving. Fighting. Hiding. These people had heard stories of a safer place, but tales of a better life were so rarely true.<br><br>\nRezyl and his companions had been tracking these Fallen for weeks. Had they caught them sooner this town would have been spared. That any survivors climbed from the rubble to see another day marked this as a victory, but Rezyl <br>\nwas growing tired of small wins, however meaningful.<br><br>\nThat evening, Rezyl and the others led a gathering of survivors on the long journey to the growing city beneath the Traveler. Some settlers remained behind, choosing to stake their claim in the untamed wilds.<br><br>\nRezyl admired their resolve, but never looked back. He knew whatever death these brave pioneers avoided that day would come to them... someday... in one form or another.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/790030_bed24e8d44dce16c9f52a48b815590b4.jpg"], "image_name": ["Rezyl Azzir - War Without End"], "filename": ["790030_bed24e8d44dce16c9f52a48b815590b4.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/790030_bed24e8d44dce16c9f52a48b815590b4.jpg", "path": "full/f653caa6a0ae0dfd56464917281caa3b565f16b2.jpg", "checksum": "10d1a8525512426e3e1da30bdd38e9d9"}]},

Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNext time doesn\u2019t matter. You lost today, and today you owe me.\u201d<br><br>\nThe Titan stared down at the Hunter, but said nothing, his hands clenched in fists. Cayde ignored the posturing and turned to face a desolate field of dirt and large rocks. A writhing mob of children spread across it, clusters of them barreling into each other as they bellowed and screamed. A much smaller number of elders waded in the chaotic sea of miniature people.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat is this? What\u2019s happening?\u201d Shaxx demanded.<br><br>\n\u201cThis City has children. Children who must stay within designated safe zones.\u201d The two Guardians watched as a boy climbed the largest rock on the field, about four feet in the air, and howled at the sky. \u201cOf course they\u2019re gonna go a little stir-crazy. Parents bring them out to this\u2014you\u2019d think it would have a name\u2014this field every month, and they have at it. Better they hit each other than climb the walls.\u201d<br><br>\nShaxx stared at them.<br><br>\n\u201cSo. You\u2019re going to pick two,\u201d Cayde said.<br><br>\nShaxx looked down at him. \u201cPick two what?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cTwo of the little brats. You\u2019ll pick a team of two, and you\u2019re going to train them in this... sport they play here. It\u2019s some kind of tournament. You know all about those.\u201d<br><br>\nShaxx surveyed the field.<br><br>\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he concluded.<br><br>\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the last time you\u2019re going to say that today, but you\u2019ve made your bed. Get comfy.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI can pay you Glimmer. Two Crucible matches\u2019 worth. Why waste my time on children?\u201d<br><br>\nA child sped past and waved at Cayde as Shaxx spoke. Cayde responded with an upward thumb. <br><br>\n\u201cI like bugging you. Plus, you\u2019d be surprised what goes on out here that only these little miscreants know about.\u201d<br><br>\nBeneath the helmet, Shaxx stared holes into the Exo\u2019s face.<br><br>\n\u201cThey run very fast. Listen, I know you\u2019re going to be you, but try to keep them intact. I make sure a Guardian they know comes to visit them once in a while. You weren\u2019t the kids\u2019 first choice, or even their tenth, but you were the only one I could get leverage on this week.\u201d<br><br>\nShaxx stood motionless, but his fury engulfed the air like a flame. Cayde turned to leave, his cloak billowing in the wind behind him. \u201cI\u2019m going to make so many Crucible bets while you\u2019re gone.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Shaxx began, but Cayde was already lost in a departing crowd of adults.<br><br>\nShaxx let out a breath, then scanned the field again, past child after squirming child. He quickly discerned the two on the field with the best athletic potential. Two human girls, snarling as they swung branches at each other, seemingly impervious to pain. He walked past them, through the crowd, and several elders paused just briefly enough in their youth wrangling to let their jaws hang. Lord Shaxx navigated the unruly sea with grace, and headed toward a lone tree in a corner of the field. An Awoken girl and a human boy sat huddled below it.<br><br>\nAs Shaxx\u2019s shadow eclipsed them, they looked up at him with the same brightness in their eyes. \u201cWhat are your names?\u201d he demanded. \u201cRuna,\u201d said the Awoken with some disdain. She returned the blank stare of Shaxx\u2019s faceplate. \u201cMy name is Lonwabo,\u201d recited the human, more like a question than a statement.<br><br>\n\u201cYou look bored, Runa,\u201d Shaxx observed. \u201cAnd you look worried, Lonwabo.\u201d He pointed at the boy, who scooted back, startled.<br><br>\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned that makes both of you more intelligent than all these other dregs,\u201d said the Titan. \u201cYou\u2019re with me. I need the rules of engagement.\u201d Shaxx stared at them, and they stared back. \u201cSomeone talk to me.\u201d<br><br>\nThey both spoke at once, and Shaxx listened in silence as they talked over each other to explain the game: Teams of two launch orb projectiles at each other, and players struck are eliminated. If both players on a team are eliminated, the team is out of the tournament, and their chance to play on the field is over.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat do you call this drill? Skirmish? Supremacy?\u201d Shaxx demanded.<br><br>\n\u201cDodge ball,\u201d said Runa.<br><br>\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work on the name. Follow my instructions, and I will lead you to victory.\u201d <br><br>\nShaxx waved one of the adults over.<br><br>\n\u201cLord\u2014Lord Shaxx?\u201d said the Exo male.<br><br>\n\u201cShaxx is fine.\u201d Only Guardians owed him respect. \u201cFind my team a match. Sooner the better.\u201d<br><br>\nShaxx brought Lonwabo and Runa to the field, and kneeled. His hands engulfed their shoulders like a pair of descending moons. \u201cMy friends. Should you be killed, others lesser than you will take your place. Don\u2019t fight for yourself. Fight for those poor fools.\u201d <br><br>\nLonwabo opened his mouth as if to speak, but hiccupped instead.<br><br>\nShaxx turned them both around to face the sun and the other team across the field. He kneeled so low that his face was level with theirs. The three stared at the opposition: two human boys, eyes glaring, fists balled in determination. Their elder stood behind them, her eyes wide as she recognized Lord Shaxx.<br><br>\nRuna yawned and rubbed her face, trying to clear the sleep from it.<br><br>\nShaxx whispered to his new charges. \u201cCrush them.\u201d</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801105_4ecd9d669532ebbfaf2f5f7242e4a5f4.jpg"], "image_name": ["Ghost Fragment: Lord Shaxx"], "filename": ["801105_4ecd9d669532ebbfaf2f5f7242e4a5f4.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801105_4ecd9d669532ebbfaf2f5f7242e4a5f4.jpg", "path": "full/df2b7b0491ba0269f3b604c7175110bc09478106.jpg", "checksum": "096defffe19f9d7d0fddeb2c5484165c"}]},

Runa had a bloody knee, and stared wordlessly at the winning team: the two snarling girls from earlier in the morning. The girls lifted an unrefined mass of plasteel, a makeshift trophy, over their heads, and they roared.<br><br>\nShaxx stared up at the Traveler. It sat, buoyed by a mantle of clouds against a blue sky. It didn\u2019t seem to notice him.<br><br>\n\u201cTell me what you\u2019ve learned,\u201d Shaxx said to Runa and Lonwabo, his faceplate fixed skyward.<br><br>\nThey did, and spoke for a continuous three minutes.

The three of them looked on as the two girls smashed the plasteel cluster into the dirt, and to the horror of all the other children, it shattered. Runa's eyes narrowed ever so slightly, a dodgeball gripped in her hands. Shaxx continued: \u201cVictory is key to survival. You need it. Need to fight for it.

{"title": "Ghost Fragment: Eris Morn", "content": "<p>The Tower\u2019s med bay was still. Guardians might operate across the system at all hours but even in the heart of the Last City, there is sometimes... quiet.<br><br>\nThe Awoken man lay upon the bed like a broken thing. Machines monitored his every twitch, every aspect of his physical status. The steady, quiet blip of his heartbeat was the dominant sound in the room. <br><br>\nA small transplex window sat in one wall of the room. Hovering there, eerily still, was a Ghost. Its single eye reflected against the inside of the window, a steady red glow.<br><br>\nIn the corner of the room sat a chair. Cheap, vinyl-covered, this chair could have been a relic from the Golden Age itself. And, suddenly, it creaked.<br><br>\nBecause, in the stillness, there was another measured source of breathing in the room. <br><br>\nEris Morn settled back into the chair, allowing the dark wisps of power she\u2019d summoned to effortlessly flow from her back into the night. The green emanations from her shroud were stark against the dimness.<br><br>\nAlmost as an afterthought, the Ghost turned from regarding the window. For a moment, three eyes stared at one, before it turned back to its watch.<br><br>\nHer face implacable, Eris regarded the Awoken in the bed. <br><br>\nHis name was Asher Mir.<br><br>\nIrascible. Annoying. Cantankerous. She\u2019d even seen Ikora Rey become... exasperated in his presence. Her lips quirked, very slightly, upwards. A kindred spirit, if she\u2019d ever had one.<br><br>\nHer smile died as her gaze slid to his side. His Warlock garb had been stripped from his body, and she could see his pale blue chest as it rose and fell in the bed. His arm. His arm was gone.<br><br>\nIn its place was a thing. The point where mechanicals knit with flesh was ghastly to behold, but the design was unmistakable to any Guardian who\u2019d been in the field: Asher Mir\u2019s arm was that of a Vex construct.<br><br>\nHer eyes flicked to the ghost at the window. It too, was transformed. The unmistakable outline of Vex technology encrusting and penetrating the small warden\u2019s shell. That red, staring eye...<br><br>\nShe stood, and stepped to the side of the bed.<br><br>\nHer voice was gentle, quiet, but its timbre filled the still air of the room. <br><br>\n\u201cI am leaving, my old friend.\u201d<br><br>\nThe man in the bed did not stir.<br><br>\n\u201cSoon I will take my leave of this\u201d\u2014she put her hands up, to take in the med bay, the City, the Tower, Earth\u2014\u201clie.\u201d<br><br>\nShe placed a gloved hand on the back of his blue, flesh-and-bone hand. \u201cI wish we could have spoken, you and I, one last time.

For a moment she allowed herself to feel the dark tears that flowed, unending, down her face. The eyes reopened, and her strength blazed in the darkness.<br><br>\n\u201cI must find a new path through the night. The Hive are vast, and ancient. A power from far beyond our realm. If we are ever truly to face them, ever truly to put an end to their hate, I must step beyond the safety of the City.\u201d<br><br>\nShe lifted her head and looked beyond the window to the horizon. To the grand sweep of the Walls, the edge of humanity\u2019s reach.<br><br>\n\u201cBe safe, Gensym Scribe. A storm is coming. And I will not be at your side when it finds its way to our shores.\u201d<br><br>\nWith those words, and a gathered locus of power, she was gone. <br><br>\nThe room returned to stillness.

I want you to understand the scope of what we\u2019re looking at here.<br><br>\nAs the fireteams fanned out across the region, the Devils rushed to meet them. Our forces dealt with some post-SIVA pockets of Splicer activity, and every once in a while the Kings popped their heads up and scared the hell out of everyone. In other words: situation absolutely normal.<br><br>\nThat\u2019s a lie. The Fallen are abandoning the Cosmodrome.<br><br>\nHawk fly-overs confirm. The House of Devils forces are simply not there anymore. They\u2019ve been disorganized for the last few years, but there\u2019s never been a shortage of ground troops whenever we staged a significant sortie. <br><br>\nIntel source GREENRAVEN was right. And, for the moment, it\u2019s worth assuming their report on the House of Exiles, House of Winter, and House of Wolves are also accurate. We\u2019re fact-checking against independent fireteam reports from the field.<br><br>\nThe kid all the SRL fans talk about \u2014 Marcus? He was in one of the fireteams out at the Cosmodrome. He pulled me aside, and said it to me straight: the Fallen Houses are gone. The siege is broken. The stalemate we\u2019ve had with the Eliksni for what, a hundred years? It\u2019s over. We won.<br><br>\nCommander, I\u2019m not even sure they\u2019re flying the banners anymore. The teams found huge mounds of burnt cloth and armor, ceremonial piles, in several of the most hardcore Fallen holdouts. <br><br>\nWhat\u2019s changed? Where have the Fallen gone? Why have they burned their banners?<br><br>\nI\u2019m drawing up a plan to coordinate forces from the Queen\u2019s Wrath, Felwinter Peak, the Warlock Orders, and more non-traditional outfits to follow up on these reports.<br><br>\nI believe your wisdom will guide us through the trials ahead.<br>\n\u2014Sloane</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801107_66c6bad8732b1ff3854f665fa12bac2f.jpg"], "image_name": ["Ghost Fragment: Fallen 6"], "filename": ["801107_66c6bad8732b1ff3854f665fa12bac2f.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801107_66c6bad8732b1ff3854f665fa12bac2f.jpg", "path": "full/346916045f1e85fc0950aae725b7a83077baaea2.jpg", "checksum": "4eedcd6882b2fa30045a7da7ea7dc0ac"}]},

{"title": "Ghost Fragment: The Reef 4", "content": "<p>He let his captors drag him through the dirt. <br><br>\nHis arms ached. Two hands wrapped around each bicep like iron bands. He slumped, and the toes of his scuffed boots bumped over the stones and left trails in the dust. He kept his eyes low, a ragged and stained cloak hanging over his face. It was not a position to which he was accustomed. <br><br>\nThey debased him. They abused him. He bit the inside of his cheek until the blood filled his mouth. He struggled not to resist. <br><br>\nThey needed to believe he was broken. That he wasn\u2019t a threat. <br><br>\nIt was the only way they would bring him before their kell. <br><br>\nHe\u2019d spent weeks weaving the illusion that led the Fallen to him. He\u2019d left bits of his trail where they couldn\u2019t help but find them. He skulked from planet to planet\u2014Mars, then Venus, then Mercury, then back again\u2014following rumors and whispers. He\u2019d hid from the Guardians, from his own people. He\u2019d let everything they had built fall apart, while those still loyal to him searched every inch of this forsaken system. <br><br>\nNow it was time to stop searching and start building. <br><br>\nHe would need soldiers who answered to him and no one else. Bodies to shape with will and magic and tech to his needs. These would serve.<br><br>\nHe thought they would take him to a ketch. But they were deep underground. Not near the Cosmodrome, but... it didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d never been particularly concerned with the geography of this blasted world. It was not his home. <br><br>\nSo he bent his head low, and listened to the guttural string of hisses and clicks issuing from the maw of a would-be king in yellow. A broken ruler of a broken house, and the last of his kind.<br><br>\nThey were more alike than he cared to admit.<br><br>\nWhen the creature\u2019s anger had burnt itself out, he raised his head to look at it. He did not need to speak. <br><br>\nOne kell rises, and another bends its knee.<br><br>\nAnd the prince felt the little hum of starlight ripple through him. The one that let him know she would be pleased with what he had done.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801110_c5cbd7dd5e9133791959edd06f66d0ce.jpg"], "image_name": ["Ghost Fragment: The Reef 4"], "filename": ["801110_c5cbd7dd5e9133791959edd06f66d0ce.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801110_c5cbd7dd5e9133791959edd06f66d0ce.jpg", "path": "full/95e93a006bae0cf9687b5995cf085a737ec3dd17.jpg", "checksum": "f9f1321d3b381fa62948108c24ae6ba2"}]}

When the Collapse struck, the great Warminds fought and died. Rasputin fell with them.<br><br>\nOr so history believed. But centuries of explorers\u2019 tales spoke of a surviving, elusive Warmind \u2013a myth substantiated when Guardians exploring the old Cosmodrome made positive contact with Rasputin. A single Warmind still lives, diminished but unbroken.<br><br>\nThreatened by a convergence of Fallen and Hive forces, Rasputin exploited the reactivation of the Cosmodrome\u2019s Terrestrial-space array to extend itself across the inner solar system. The Guardian Vanguard hoped that Rasputin might make a powerful ally, capable of mapping and reviving Golden Age military assets and recruiting them for the City\u2019s defense. But Rasputin has proven recalcitrant and high-handed, unresponsive to the City\u2019s outreach.<br><br>\nWe cannot characterize Rasputin\u2019s strategic objectives and capabilities, cannot define its physical or computational architecture, cannot ascertain its disposition with regard to the City, and cannot be sure it retains memory of events before the Collapse. Perhaps what remains is only an autonomic shell, defending itself by reflex. Or perhaps Rasputin\u2019s objectives have changed, transformed by some vital information it obtained during those dark days.<br><br>\nRasputin\u2019s survival opens the possibility that other Warminds may be revivable, opening weapons systems to aid in City defenses. The Vanguard and the Consensus hope that continued outreach towards Rasputin will develop into a strategic alliance.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/107010_25097097211250951c97d4a1f97ca0a5.jpg"], "image_name": ["Rasputin"], "filename": ["107010_25097097211250951c97d4a1f97ca0a5.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/107010_25097097211250951c97d4a1f97ca0a5.jpg", "path": "full/99223e93019b4a40b7b480ddda400ee12a8efccb.jpg", "checksum": "238cdb5fd101fc260ca7d5873385ff9d"}]},

She wonders whether she will ever stand in the Tower courtyard and look up at the stars waiting for ruin.<br><br>\nThe Vex erupt from nothingness and crash down over the Cabal in formations of golden light. Lightning arcs and snaps and gives birth to marching ranks of bronze warrior hulls. Gun positions thunder back. Tracers sweep the sky and she can feel on her skin the electromagnetic howl of Cabal munitions seeking targets and the prickle of stranger signals that whisper of broken space and bent time.

Testing its heft.<br><br>\nThen dawn light, a terrible dawn\u2014the sky opens up to admit devastation, thrown down from orbit: Minotaurs fall burnt and broken with their fluids boiling out. Cabal guns detonate in thunderous chains as tiny piercing flechettes fall out of the sky and find their ammunition bunkers.<br><br>\nThe battle stops. The Vex wink out. On the Cabal network the voice of Valus Ta'aurc roars: Find the source! Rouse the Flayers and find the source!<br><br>\nShe remembers word from Earth: the Array opened. A ghost of the Cosmodrome set loose. And she wonders who won this battle, who learned the most, the Vex baiting out this new power, or the Cabal hunting it.

Out in the field I never had a second thought.<br><br>\nMy old friend Andal\u2014he used to stand here, right in this spot\u2014he'd come up with these wild stories. He'd say, you know, Cayde, I've been examining the evidence, and personally I've come to think it's you. You're Rasputin, legendary Warmind, defender of Earth. And I wish you'd remember that, so you could reclaim your full power and save us all.<br><br>\nYou can see how that'd be embarrassing, especially when he'd say it right in front of Zavala, who already thought I was wasting my life scrounging for engrams. You know how Zavala gets. But I'd just say, well, Andal, you might be on to something there, but if I'm honest with you I think coordinating our defense throughout the solar system sounds exhausting, so I'd best leave it to you.<br><br>\nThen Andal goes and plays his final joke, and I end up as the punchline. So here I stand, reading reports, giving orders, and getting my worry on.<br><br>\nOne day I ask Ikora, hey, of course I know all about Rasputin, but really, what are we looking for? When Rahool asks for crashed warsats, when we send Holborn to Mars to look for computers, when Zavala gets all gruff about the Fallen in the Cosmodrome\u2014what are we really after? If I left my post and got my ship and just went out there tomorrow, real heroic, and I found Rasputin, what would happen?<br><br>\nWould we all be saved?<br><br>\nGood question, she says\u2014hang on, let me do my Ikora voice. As you know, Cayde, Rasputin pretty much ran the Golden Age, especially all the secret military business. Rasputin had antimatter-powered death rays and a hundred thousand satellites and nearly as much brainpower as me. Rasputin fought the Collapse. It knows things we need.<br><br>\nRight, I said, but Rasputin lost. The Traveler saved us.<br><br>\nBut the Traveler's silent now, Ikora said, and Rasputin lives. Right now Rasputin is out there, reaching out, rebuilding, growing.<br><br>\nSo I say what I want to say every day, it's no secret, I say\u2014well, I'll go find it, then. I'll go tell Rasputin we need its help.<br><br>\nAnd Ikora looks at me with one of those looks that\u2014you know sometimes you talk to Ikora and you just think, wow, you are not even using a fraction of your brain on me, are you? One of those looks. She says: Cayde, the problem isn't just that we can't find Rasputin. The problem is that it's not clear to any of us Rasputin wants to be found.<br><br>\nThat's the way things seem to turn out, up here in the Tower. Nothing simple to do. No easy answers.<br><br>\nAnd all I can think is, if Rasputin had all those mighty tools, and it lost\u2014what did it learn? What's it going to try this time around? When I hear about the Dust Palace, those Psion Flayers getting into Rasputin's mind, I wonder... what would they talk about, Rasputin and those creatures?<br><br>\n'I was a servant too.

Scars marred his armor, and his sidearm lay in the dust. He didn't need it, now. The battle was over.<br><br>\nThis had been a mining outpost, once. A few buildings and a transport. Nestled amid a small forest, it had been like a precious jewel set atop the dull crown of the wildlands.<br><br>\nNow there was almost nothing left. The warrior began to walk slowly down into the valley. He pulled his helm from his head and let it drop with a muted thud into the ash. Of the forest, only stumps remained. Of the small village there was no trace; the buildings reduced to splinters. Here and there you could see dull gray signs of inhabitation.<br><br>\nAt the bottom of the valley, Radegast came to the source of the ash, death, and violence. The Light-bearers were laid out in a row, simple cloth covering their armored and robed forms.

Allowing the power of the Light to blind us to what we truly are.\"<br><br>\nIt was Perun, of course, who asked the question. \"What are we?\" No judgment. No reproach. <br><br>\nStill, Radegast could feel their doubt. He turned upwards, and his eyes settled on the massive span that supported the hall. His eyes shone as he turned back to his fellows.<br><br>\n\"We will be what the people need us to be. We will be guardians. We will be protectors. We will hold the last of us together.\"<br><br>\nHis voice rang out across the still valley. \"Our days of hiding are ended. Say it now, each of you. Who among the other bearers do you trust?

Ships of all sizes and shapes can be seen, from venerable craft that have been salvaged from the Golden Age through to City designs to vessels that have yet to emerge from the Shipwright's hangars.<br><br>\nThe ships are battle-scarred. Many are barely spaceworthy. As warp drives wind down several seem to lose power and begin to drift. Some of the largest craft bear imagery familiar to frequent visitors to the tower: Dead Orbit symbols, the simple icon of the Vanguard. The New Monarchy and Future War Cult as well, though fewer examples can be seen. Others bears symbols never seen in the Tower to date.<br><br>\nEvery single ship, from the largest cruiser to the smallest personal craft, carries shards of stone, remnants of the City and the Tower. Banners too, tattered and worn from entering and leaving warp.<br><br>\nThe fleet is only visible for a few breaths, less than a minute. Then, with a massive flash of light, the fleet jumps on. The craft that have lost power are left behind, spinning and whirling away from the etheric wake of their powered fellows. The Ghost spins on, and soon enough only stars fill its field of view until the fragment ends.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/700400_94255063e2bb49a3ded71845450c2d83.jpg"], "image_name": ["Mystery: The Vault of Glass 3"], "filename": ["700400_94255063e2bb49a3ded71845450c2d83.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/700400_94255063e2bb49a3ded71845450c2d83.jpg", "path": "full/3dd87185f9061313b821eea0650a997f635dda44.jpg", "checksum": "2a79c6910f70ae02513085c0a7718bc7"}]},

Beneath it the Vandal\u2019s neck gave; a hiss of ether burst free before dissipating.<br><br>\nRezyl turned. Three Dregs charged. Their Captain raised his shock blade high, unleashing a battle cry to fuel their courage.<br><br>\nFocused fire spit from the muzzle of Rezyl\u2019s full-auto. The Dregs fell.<br><br>\nTo the Captain, Rezyl was a trophy that would buy unmatched respect among his Devil brothers.<br><br>\nTo Rezyl, the Captain was already an afterthought. As ether leaked from the pirate\u2019s broken body with each blow of Rezyl\u2019s heavy fists, Rezyl\u2019s attention had shifted to the unknown, but inevitable, battles to follow.<br><br>\nThis was the state of things; conflict as common as breath.<br><br>\n\u2014 The Tescan Valley Encounter \u2014<br><br>\nA Ketch with unfamiliar markings hung low between two peaks. A rare sight. Fallen flagships weren\u2019t known to linger so close to the surface, preferring constant motion, like sharks on the hunt.<br><br>\nSkiffs circled below the Ketch as their crews prepared to plunder any treasures the facility held.<br><br>\nRezyl leveled his rocket launcher. A digital ping signaled a lock, and a trail of smoke shot toward the lead Skiff.<br><br>\nTwo more rockets followed in rapid succession.<br><br>\nThe lead Skiff took two hits, lurched and retreated back toward the Ketch above.<br><br>\nThe third rocket caught a trailing Skiff as the craft turned to engage its attackers.<br><br>\nRezyl looked back. \u201cGo.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take a Ketch alone,\u201d Hassa laughed.<br><br>\n\u201cThe ship isn\u2019t my target,\u201d Rezyl had a plan.

Rezyl watched from cover as the Skiffs gave chase.<br><br>\nThe Fallen below had taken defensive positions. The rocket attack caught them off guard but they were ready now, and there were more of them than he had time to count.<br><br>\nRezyl raced down the slope, weaving between the thick growth of brush and pine, on a direct path for the Fallen clustered at the mountain\u2019s base, his Ghost at his side.<br><br>\n\u201cI need you to hang back.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cUhhh...\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cTrust me.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAlways have.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHow quick can you light my spark?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou expect to die?

Eager Dregs rushed and were met with death as Rezyl marched forward.<br><br>\nA massive blast cratered the ground a few feet from the Titan. The Ketch had turned its guns on Rezyl.<br><br>\nAnother blast impacted to Rezyl\u2019s left and he stumbled. A third exploded directly in his path...<br><br>\n...and Rezyl fell.<br><br>\nFrom the treeline, his Ghost watched as the Fallen celebrated and a Skiff drifted down from the Ketch above.<br><br>\nThe circle around Rezyl\u2019s body parted and the imposing figure of their Kell stepped forward to admire his prize.<br><br>\nThe chittering excitement quieted to a steady drone as the Kell lifted Rezyl\u2019s limp body by the neck.<br><br>\nA chorus rose among the crew, growing louder as the Kell hefted Rezyl over his head for all to see.<br><br>\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost darted low through the crowd. He didn\u2019t like Rezyl\u2019s plan, but now he understood it.<br><br>\nDistracted by their Kell\u2019s triumph, the Ghost\u2019s presence went unnoticed until a beam of light swept over Rezyl\u2019s body.<br><br>\nThe mood shifted instantly, cheers turning to ravenous shouts.<br><br>\nThe Kell\u2019s gaze fell to the Ghost as the beam faded.<br><br>\nThe circle began to collapse \u2014 the Fallen set to pounce.<br><br>\nAs the Kell moved to toss Rezyl aside, cold steel met the underside of the alien marauder\u2019s jaw, followed by a red flash as Rezyl pulled his cannon\u2019s trigger.<br><br>\nEther spewed in an angry geyser and the Kell\u2019s grip loosened. Rezyl hit the ground and unloaded five more rounds into the Fallen leader\u2019s torso. The monster dropped.<br><br>\nFrenzied, the Kell\u2019s crew closed in like a flood.<br><br>\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost lifted above the fray, frantic, \u201cNow! Now! Now!\u201d<br><br>\nIn one motion, Rezyl rose from a crouch, his fists clenched and raised high as a storm of Arc Light built within him, his full might raining down on the Kell\u2019s chest. The shockwave of Rezyl\u2019s attack hit like a meteor, shattering <br>\nthe Kell\u2019s body and any Fallen within the Havoc storm\u2019s radius.<br><br>\nThe remaining Fallen staggered, knocked back and dazed.<br><br>\nRezyl triggered his Sparrow.<br><br>\nHis Ghost flew to his side, \u201cWe leaving?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBefore that Ketch opens up on us.\u201d<br><br>\nRezyl punched the throttle as the Fallen crew opened fire.<br><br>\n\u201cLet\u2019s never do that again,\u201d his Ghost pleaded.<br><br>\nRezyl didn\u2019t have to reply. If war was a constant, \u201cnever\u201d was just an illusion. <br><br>\n\u2014 In Defense of North Channel \u2014<br><br>\nWinds from the south caught the smoke and began to clear the thick air.<br><br>\nSlowly, the citizens of the small, snow-covered settlement came out from their hiding places.<br><br>\nRezyl surveyed their faces \u2014 each weary, but flecked with hope. <br><br>\nLiving in the wilds was all they had known. Surviving. Fighting. Hiding. These people had heard stories of a safer place, but tales of a better life were so rarely true.<br><br>\nRezyl and his companions had been tracking these Fallen for weeks. Had they caught them sooner this town would have been spared. That any survivors climbed from the rubble to see another day marked this as a victory, but Rezyl <br>\nwas growing tired of small wins, however meaningful.<br><br>\nThat evening, Rezyl and the others led a gathering of survivors on the long journey to the growing city beneath the Traveler. Some settlers remained behind, choosing to stake their claim in the untamed wilds.<br><br>\nRezyl admired their resolve, but never looked back. He knew whatever death these brave pioneers avoided that day would come to them... someday... in one form or another.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/790030_bed24e8d44dce16c9f52a48b815590b4.jpg"], "image_name": ["Rezyl Azzir - War Without End"], "filename": ["790030_bed24e8d44dce16c9f52a48b815590b4.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/790030_bed24e8d44dce16c9f52a48b815590b4.jpg", "path": "full/f653caa6a0ae0dfd56464917281caa3b565f16b2.jpg", "checksum": "10d1a8525512426e3e1da30bdd38e9d9"}]},

You lost today, and today you owe me.\u201d<br><br>\nThe Titan stared down at the Hunter, but said nothing, his hands clenched in fists. Cayde ignored the posturing and turned to face a desolate field of dirt and large rocks. A writhing mob of children spread across it, clusters of them barreling into each other as they bellowed and screamed. A much smaller number of elders waded in the chaotic sea of miniature people.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat is this? What\u2019s happening?\u201d Shaxx demanded.<br><br>\n\u201cThis City has children. Children who must stay within designated safe zones.\u201d The two Guardians watched as a boy climbed the largest rock on the field, about four feet in the air, and howled at the sky. \u201cOf course they\u2019re gonna go a little stir-crazy. Parents bring them out to this\u2014you\u2019d think it would have a name\u2014this field every month, and they have at it. Better they hit each other than climb the walls.\u201d<br><br>\nShaxx stared at them.<br><br>\n\u201cSo. You\u2019re going to pick two,\u201d Cayde said.<br><br>\nShaxx looked down at him. \u201cPick two what?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cTwo of the little brats. You\u2019ll pick a team of two, and you\u2019re going to train them in this... sport they play here. It\u2019s some kind of tournament. You know all about those.\u201d<br><br>\nShaxx surveyed the field.<br><br>\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he concluded.<br><br>\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the last time you\u2019re going to say that today, but you\u2019ve made your bed. Get comfy.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI can pay you Glimmer. Two Crucible matches\u2019 worth. Why waste my time on children?\u201d<br><br>\nA child sped past and waved at Cayde as Shaxx spoke. Cayde responded with an upward thumb. <br><br>\n\u201cI like bugging you. Plus, you\u2019d be surprised what goes on out here that only these little miscreants know about.\u201d<br><br>\nBeneath the helmet, Shaxx stared holes into the Exo\u2019s face.<br><br>\n\u201cThey run very fast. Listen, I know you\u2019re going to be you, but try to keep them intact. I make sure a Guardian they know comes to visit them once in a while. You weren\u2019t the kids\u2019 first choice, or even their tenth, but you were the only one I could get leverage on this week.\u201d<br><br>\nShaxx stood motionless, but his fury engulfed the air like a flame. Cayde turned to leave, his cloak billowing in the wind behind him. \u201cI\u2019m going to make so many Crucible bets while you\u2019re gone.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Shaxx began, but Cayde was already lost in a departing crowd of adults.<br><br>\nShaxx let out a breath, then scanned the field again, past child after squirming child. He quickly discerned the two on the field with the best athletic potential. Two human girls, snarling as they swung branches at each other, seemingly impervious to pain. He walked past them, through the crowd, and several elders paused just briefly enough in their youth wrangling to let their jaws hang. Lord Shaxx navigated the unruly sea with grace, and headed toward a lone tree in a corner of the field. An Awoken girl and a human boy sat huddled below it.<br><br>\nAs Shaxx\u2019s shadow eclipsed them, they looked up at him with the same brightness in their eyes. \u201cWhat are your names?\u201d he demanded. \u201cRuna,\u201d said the Awoken with some disdain. She returned the blank stare of Shaxx\u2019s faceplate. \u201cMy name is Lonwabo,\u201d recited the human, more like a question than a statement.<br><br>\n\u201cYou look bored, Runa,\u201d Shaxx observed. \u201cAnd you look worried, Lonwabo.\u201d He pointed at the boy, who scooted back, startled.<br><br>\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned that makes both of you more intelligent than all these other dregs,\u201d said the Titan. \u201cYou\u2019re with me. I need the rules of engagement.\u201d Shaxx stared at them, and they stared back. \u201cSomeone talk to me.\u201d<br><br>\nThey both spoke at once, and Shaxx listened in silence as they talked over each other to explain the game: Teams of two launch orb projectiles at each other, and players struck are eliminated. If both players on a team are eliminated, the team is out of the tournament, and their chance to play on the field is over.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat do you call this drill? Skirmish? Supremacy?\u201d Shaxx demanded.<br><br>\n\u201cDodge ball,\u201d said Runa.<br><br>\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work on the name. Follow my instructions, and I will lead you to victory.\u201d <br><br>\nShaxx waved one of the adults over.<br><br>\n\u201cLord\u2014Lord Shaxx?\u201d said the Exo male.<br><br>\n\u201cShaxx is fine.\u201d Only Guardians owed him respect. \u201cFind my team a match. Sooner the better.\u201d<br><br>\nShaxx brought Lonwabo and Runa to the field, and kneeled. His hands engulfed their shoulders like a pair of descending moons. \u201cMy friends. Should you be killed, others lesser than you will take your place. Don\u2019t fight for yourself. Fight for those poor fools.\u201d <br><br>\nLonwabo opened his mouth as if to speak, but hiccupped instead.<br><br>\nShaxx turned them both around to face the sun and the other team across the field. He kneeled so low that his face was level with theirs. The three stared at the opposition: two human boys, eyes glaring, fists balled in determination. Their elder stood behind them, her eyes wide as she recognized Lord Shaxx.<br><br>\nRuna yawned and rubbed her face, trying to clear the sleep from it.<br><br>\nShaxx whispered to his new charges. \u201cCrush them.\u201d</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801105_4ecd9d669532ebbfaf2f5f7242e4a5f4.jpg"], "image_name": ["Ghost Fragment: Lord Shaxx"], "filename": ["801105_4ecd9d669532ebbfaf2f5f7242e4a5f4.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801105_4ecd9d669532ebbfaf2f5f7242e4a5f4.jpg", "path": "full/df2b7b0491ba0269f3b604c7175110bc09478106.jpg", "checksum": "096defffe19f9d7d0fddeb2c5484165c"}]},

Runa had a bloody knee, and stared wordlessly at the winning team: the two snarling girls from earlier in the morning. The girls lifted an unrefined mass of plasteel, a makeshift trophy, over their heads, and they roared.<br><br>\nShaxx stared up at the Traveler. It sat, buoyed by a mantle of clouds against a blue sky. It didn\u2019t seem to notice him.<br><br>\n\u201cTell me what you\u2019ve learned,\u201d Shaxx said to Runa and Lonwabo, his faceplate fixed skyward.<br><br>\nThey did, and spoke for a continuous three minutes.

The three of them looked on as the two girls smashed the plasteel cluster into the dirt, and to the horror of all the other children, it shattered.

Guardians might operate across the system at all hours but even in the heart of the Last City, there is sometimes... quiet.<br><br>\nThe Awoken man lay upon the bed like a broken thing. Machines monitored his every twitch, every aspect of his physical status. The steady, quiet blip of his heartbeat was the dominant sound in the room. <br><br>\nA small transplex window sat in one wall of the room. Hovering there, eerily still, was a Ghost. Its single eye reflected against the inside of the window, a steady red glow.<br><br>\nIn the corner of the room sat a chair. Cheap, vinyl-covered, this chair could have been a relic from the Golden Age itself. And, suddenly, it creaked.<br><br>\nBecause, in the stillness, there was another measured source of breathing in the room. <br><br>\nEris Morn settled back into the chair, allowing the dark wisps of power she\u2019d summoned to effortlessly flow from her back into the night. The green emanations from her shroud were stark against the dimness.<br><br>\nAlmost as an afterthought, the Ghost turned from regarding the window. For a moment, three eyes stared at one, before it turned back to its watch.<br><br>\nHer face implacable, Eris regarded the Awoken in the bed. <br><br>\nHis name was Asher Mir.<br><br>\nIrascible. Annoying. Cantankerous. She\u2019d even seen Ikora Rey become... exasperated in his presence. Her lips quirked, very slightly, upwards. A kindred spirit, if she\u2019d ever had one.<br><br>\nHer smile died as her gaze slid to his side. His Warlock garb had been stripped from his body, and she could see his pale blue chest as it rose and fell in the bed. His arm. His arm was gone.<br><br>\nIn its place was a thing. The point where mechanicals knit with flesh was ghastly to behold, but the design was unmistakable to any Guardian who\u2019d been in the field: Asher Mir\u2019s arm was that of a Vex construct.<br><br>\nHer eyes flicked to the ghost at the window. It too, was transformed. The unmistakable outline of Vex technology encrusting and penetrating the small warden\u2019s shell. That red, staring eye...<br><br>\nShe stood, and stepped to the side of the bed.<br><br>\nHer voice was gentle, quiet, but its timbre filled the still air of the room. <br><br>\n\u201cI am leaving, my old friend.\u201d<br><br>\nThe man in the bed did not stir.<br><br>\n\u201cSoon I will take my leave of this\u201d\u2014she put her hands up, to take in the med bay, the City, the Tower, Earth\u2014\u201clie.\u201d<br><br>\nShe placed a gloved hand on the back of his blue, flesh-and-bone hand. \u201cI wish we could have spoken, you and I, one last time.

For a moment she allowed herself to feel the dark tears that flowed, unending, down her face. The eyes reopened, and her strength blazed in the darkness.<br><br>\n\u201cI must find a new path through the night. The Hive are vast, and ancient. A power from far beyond our realm. If we are ever truly to face them, ever truly to put an end to their hate, I must step beyond the safety of the City.\u201d<br><br>\nShe lifted her head and looked beyond the window to the horizon. To the grand sweep of the Walls, the edge of humanity\u2019s reach.<br><br>\n\u201cBe safe, Gensym Scribe. A storm is coming.

    {"title": "Ghost Fragment: Rasputin", "content": "<p>People say I'm a real confident guy. That's true enough. Out in the field I never had a second thought.<br><br>\nMy old friend Andal\u2014he used to stand here, right in this spot\u2014he'd come up with these wild stories. He'd say, you know, Cayde, I've been examining the evidence, and personally I've come to think it's you. You're Rasputin, legendary Warmind, defender of Earth. And I wish you'd remember that, so you could reclaim your full power and save us all.<br><br>\nYou can see how that'd be embarrassing, especially when he'd say it right in front of Zavala, who already thought I was wasting my life scrounging for engrams. You know how Zavala gets. But I'd just say, well, Andal, you might be on to something there, but if I'm honest with you I think coordinating our defense throughout the solar system sounds exhausting, so I'd best leave it to you.<br><br>\nThen Andal goes and plays his final joke, and I end up as the punchline. So here I stand, reading reports, giving orders, and getting my worry on.<br><br>\nOne day I ask Ikora, hey, of course I know all about Rasputin, but really, what are we looking for? When Rahool asks for crashed warsats, when we send Holborn to Mars to look for computers, when Zavala gets all gruff about the Fallen in the Cosmodrome\u2014what are we really after? If I left my post and got my ship and just went out there tomorrow, real heroic, and I found Rasputin, what would happen?<br><br>\nWould we all be saved?<br><br>\nGood question, she says\u2014hang on, let me do my Ikora voice. As you know, Cayde, Rasputin pretty much ran the Golden Age, especially all the secret military business. Rasputin had antimatter-powered death rays and a hundred thousand satellites and nearly as much brainpower as me. Rasputin fought the Collapse. It knows things we need.<br><br>\nRight, I said, but Rasputin lost. The Traveler saved us.<br><br>\nBut the Traveler's silent now, Ikora said, and Rasputin lives. Right now Rasputin is out there, reaching out, rebuilding, growing.<br><br>\nSo I say what I want to say every day, it's no secret, I say\u2014well, I'll go find it, then. I'll go tell Rasputin we need its help.<br><br>\nAnd Ikora looks at me with one of those looks that\u2014you know sometimes you talk to Ikora and you just think, wow, you are not even using a fraction of your brain on me, are you? One of those looks. She says: Cayde, the problem isn't just that we can't find Rasputin. The problem is that it's not clear to any of us Rasputin wants to be found.<br><br>\nThat's the way things seem to turn out, up here in the Tower. Nothing simple to do. No easy answers.<br><br>\nAnd all I can think is, if Rasputin had all those mighty tools, and it lost\u2014what did it learn? What's it going to try this time around?

        "Everything changed with the coming of the Traveler.\n\nIt gave us gifts that transformed the solar system and the nature of human life. It ushered in the Golden Age, a time of miracles. But it never shared its deepest secrets.\n\nWhere did the Traveler come from? Why did it offer us so much? Did it know it was being hunted across the stars? And why, when the Darkness came, did it choose to stay and fight for us?\n\nNow the Traveler hangs, silent, above humanity's final sanctuary. It may be healing. It may be dying. It gave everything it had to save us. And now its power lies with us, its Guardians.",

But you have no recollection of ever wanting worship or even thanks from those blessed by you. \n\nBut memory is heavy now. \n\nIt feels like lead and neutronium and electroweak matter fashioned into a moon-sized ball that you must carry as you move. \n\nNow, your flight is rapid, your vast mind infected with such dread and toxic doubt that you find yourself afraid of the simple act of thought. \n\nAnd it is your children you must turn to now, in time of need.",

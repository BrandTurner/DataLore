			"The knife had a million blades.\n\nAnd you were giant, powerful and swift. But the knife pinned you. Cut your godly flesh away.\n\nVery little was left, you are sure, because you feel insignificant now. The hard slick heart of your soul: That is what remains. A body small as a river stone, and just as simple. You picture yourself as a piece of indigestible grit, a nameless nothing hiding among other nameless stones. Perhaps you glitter like a gem, yes. Pride makes you hope so. If only you could see yourself. But you have no eyes. Not the dimmest sense survives. What lives is memory, and what slim portion of these thoughts can you trust?\n\nThe knife stole much more than your body.",

And why, when the Darkness came, did it choose to stay and fight for us?\n\nNow the Traveler hangs, silent, above humanity's final sanctuary. It may be healing. It may be dying. It gave everything it had to save us. And now its power lies with us, its Guardians.",

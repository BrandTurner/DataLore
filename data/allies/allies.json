We came here on behalf of the Fleet. We were scavengers. Sixty-one days ago a Dead Orbit scout detected an unknown presence in stationary orbit about Ceres. 133 west. Looked Golden Age, by the signatures. Human. A small station. No prior records. We - \n\nI suppose we should have disclosed it to the Tower, but we didn't. I didn't. That was my call.

They saw us at once. We dropped and the alarms went off and that was the end, that was the end right then, but they let us go on for another seven-point-five days, didn't they? The alarms. Hostile scan detected. An Awoken ship had us in its sights, just a couple hundred kilometers away. Like it had been waiting for us. It could have wiped us out of space right then but instead it crippled our engines and our comms and then for days it played with us, like a cat, we limped half-way round the Belt and it was always there...\n\nWe abandoned the Sophia one-point-five days ago.

Once, I was proud to call myself a Corsair in your service. My sisters and I were the sharp edge of your will, cutting across the stars in protection of the Reef.\n\nIt was your service that kept me from sorrow after Amethyst was razed. The loss of my sisters, my whole life, as our station burned... it took something from me.\n\nBy your will, it was given back to me.\n\nPromoting me to the Corsairs, allowing me to strike back at the Wolves. Letting my fury find purchase in defense, in support, and in glorious battle. I know, as I\u2019m sure you did, that without focus my heart would have grown toxic.\n\nIt was my pride in my position that sustained me through the Hildean Campaign. That led me to victory in battle against Veliniks, the \"Forgotten Kell\", the last hope for the unchained Wolves. I know now that it was my willful pride that brought me low.\n\nMy lady, I offer again the only explanation I can: I did not know the Guardians would act as they did. All I had known, all I had ever known, were the ways of the Awoken.\n\nThe Wolves were entrenched in that valley. The approaches were blocked, all sight lines covered. An assault on their position was madness. We would have spent precious Awoken lives. For nothing. I saw the Guardians, knew they were on the move, but I assumed they saw the situation as we did. That it was folly to call in the Crows.\n\nPrince Uldren\u2019s fighter wing did a masterful job. The blast was pinpoint precise. The blasts tore apart the Wolves, and the Guardians, and their Ghosts. Three strike teams of Guardians, gone in an instant, on my order.

Out in the field I never had a second thought.\n\nMy old friend Andal\u2014he used to stand here, right in this spot\u2014he'd come up with these wild stories. He'd say, you know, Cayde, I've been examining the evidence, and personally I've come to think it's you. You're Rasputin, legendary Warmind, defender of Earth. And I wish you'd remember that, so you could reclaim your full power and save us all.\n\nYou can see how that'd be embarrassing, especially when he'd say it right in front of Zavala, who already thought I was wasting my life scrounging for engrams. You know how Zavala gets. But I'd just say, well, Andal, you might be on to something there, but if I'm honest with you I think coordinating our defense throughout the solar system sounds exhausting, so I'd best leave it to you.\n\nThen Andal goes and plays his final joke, and I end up as the punchline. So here I stand, reading reports, giving orders, and getting my worry on.\n\nOne day I ask Ikora, hey, of course I know all about Rasputin, but really, what are we looking for? When Rahool asks for crashed warsats, when we send Holborn to Mars to look for computers, when Zavala gets all gruff about the Fallen in the Cosmodrome\u2014what are we really after? If I left my post and got my ship and just went out there tomorrow, real heroic, and I found Rasputin, what would happen?\n\nWould we all be saved?\n\nGood question, she says\u2014hang on, let me do my Ikora voice. As you know, Cayde, Rasputin pretty much ran the Golden Age, especially all the secret military business. Rasputin had antimatter-powered death rays and a hundred thousand satellites and nearly as much brainpower as me. Rasputin fought the Collapse. It knows things we need.\n\nRight, I said, but Rasputin lost. The Traveler saved us.\n\nBut the Traveler's silent now, Ikora said, and Rasputin lives. Right now Rasputin is out there, reaching out, rebuilding, growing.\n\nSo I say what I want to say every day, it's no secret, I say\u2014well, I'll go find it, then. I'll go tell Rasputin we need its help.\n\nAnd Ikora looks at me with one of those looks that\u2014you know sometimes you talk to Ikora and you just think, wow, you are not even using a fraction of your brain on me, are you? One of those looks. She says: Cayde, the problem isn't just that we can't find Rasputin. The problem is that it's not clear to any of us Rasputin wants to be found.\n\nThat's the way things seem to turn out, up here in the Tower. Nothing simple to do. No easy answers.\n\nAnd all I can think is, if Rasputin had all those mighty tools, and it lost\u2014what did it learn? What's it going to try this time around? When I hear about the Dust Palace, those Psion Flayers getting into Rasputin's mind, I wonder... what would they talk about, Rasputin and those creatures?\n\n'I was a servant too. I was an instrument of war, bound to the will of a lesser master.

All you will ever do is kill. You do not belong here. This is a place of life.\n\nThe Traveler is life, I said. You are a creature of Darkness. You seek to deceive me.\n\nBut I looked behind me, down the long slope where the blossoms tumbled in the warm wind and the great trees wept sap like blood or wine, and I felt doubt.\n\nWhen my Ghost raised me from the sea there was a thorn-cut in my left hand and it has not healed since.", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/106070_78ecae59c69157ffcb052bd534f19808.jpg"], "image_name": ["Legend: The Black Garden"], "filename": ["106070_78ecae59c69157ffcb052bd534f19808.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/106070_78ecae59c69157ffcb052bd534f19808.jpg", "path": "full/8ed80696b222e48d572f7d6a0d4e7e7f1d70abc7.jpg", "checksum": "a029c6c17c5ea3140b632da8aa866389"}]},

Skolas, Wolf Kell, stumbles out and crashes to his knees.\n\nHe tries to leap at the creature before him, the shape in the fog, to show it why it should be afraid. But the weight of grief smashes his legs against the cell. The rage upon him beats him to the floor. He falls on all four hands, his mighty armor thundering against itself.\n\nHis House of Wolves is enslaved! His people have been played! And it was his hubris, his would-be cunning that did it! While the other Houses fought for their future on Earth, throwing themselves at the Great Machine, Skolas wasted his people in games of betrayal and ambition. Bitter pride brought a bitter end!\n\nIf Skolas were a Kell he would ask his Archon to dock him. Ether hisses in his mask and it tastes cold, so cold.\n\nHe looks up. At the tiny hooded shape before him. The cell's mist is clearing. He can see.\n\n\"I believe that I am here,\" the creature says. To Skolas' ears it has a strange voice, a strange accent. It speaks his language. \"I have a clear purpose. I cannot explain it. Forgive me.\"\n\nFrom beneath its hood, tiny fingers of shadow probe the air.\n\nSkolas rises up to smash it, to show his strength, because the alternative to violence is waiting for violence to come from a universe that has neither respect nor compassion. But he checks himself. His ambitions have brought him here, to this cell in this strange place... only it's not so strange, is it? It's the hold of a Ketch. \"The Queen,\" he says to the thing. \"You work for the Queen.\"\n\n\"The Nine made me aware of my purpose,\" the creature says. \"If am here, then it is because the Queen sent you to the Nine, and they wish you sent back.\"\n\n\"I will do no one else's work.\" Skolas has been a pawn long enough. A Dreg told him, once, that she would play in a game as long as the game made sense. Nothing makes sense now except the thought of Variks' throat shattering in his fists. Variks! Variks the utterly disloyal, Variks who should be welded into a Ketch's prow atom by atom and left there as a figurehead to burn away.\n\n\"I am comfortable,\" the creature with the moving face says. \"A part of me wants to go somewhere warm. Now I will certainly tell you what you have been given.\"\n\nSkolas looks at the shrapnel gun in his hands. Skolas imagines what he would do with it if he could reach Variks, or the brother of the Queen, or the alien Queen. Will it save anything they've lost? The worlds docked from them? No. It cannot change the past. Only the future. Only the chance that his people might one day know themselves as more than pirates and scavengers.\n\nHe should never have tried to be Kell of Wolves. He should have tried to be Kell of everything. Everything wants to kill his people, the machines and the militants and the green-eyed Hive. The dead soldiers that hoard the Great Machine and come out crusading to wipe all hope away.\n\n\"The ship will be yours,\" the creature says. It hunches over itself as if burdened by its own shape. \"If you speak, you will be heard. I will go now. You are free.\"\n\nHe tries to follow it. He fails. Somehow it is gone.

He made a fleeting effort to break the rifle free, but had to let it fall away as the rush of demons increased. \n\nRezyl kicked the other monster to the floor, stepping on its neck while shifting to backhand a throng of attackers eager to make their killing lunge.\n\nIf the rifle\u2014his battle-worn Inferno\u2014had served to thin the herd and buy Rezyl time to assess the whole of the situation, his Rose would see him through.\n\nIt always had.\n\nThe Titan, awash in the ash and gore of his enemies, pulled his cannon and in one motion feathered the trigger to level the wretched beasts closest to him.\n\nThe bloom from each shot lit the cavern with flashes of red heat \u2014 a garden of angry roses blossoming in pointed defiance of this vile, hateful kingdom of shadows.\n\nOn the far end of the sea of gnashing maws, the wicked woman danced in the air.\n\nWatching.\n\nWaiting?\n\nRezyl\u2019s cannon was loaded and ready to fire as if an afterthought.\n\nHe let loose another barrage and six more demons slumped, lifeless upon the pile.\n\nThe witch unleashed a violent cry. \n\nAnd as quickly as it had begun, the onslaught subsided.\n\nThe chittering fell from a deafening roar to an eerie chorus humming through the ebon haze just beyond his sight.\n\nRezyl stood, straightened his tired back and took long, deep breaths.\n\nThe storm had not been weathered. \n\nHe could feel it in his gut.\n\nHe stood now, not at peace, but within the eye \u2013 the swirling, terrible lull before the waves came crashing once more.\n\nThe wicked woman laughed: a horrid, grating screech.\n\nFollowed by footsteps. Heavy and hard.\n\nThoom.\n\nThoom.\n\nThoom.\n\nThoom.\n\nRezyl squinted against the dark as he slid new lead into his cannon\u2019s cylinder. \n\nA shape took form, approaching from the deep. \n\nA being of might and mass that dwarfed the Titan. \n\nA cleaver the size of an ordinary man\u2014bigger\u2014hung effortlessly in its hand.\n\nIts body was thick with ornate bone \u2013 a living armor that was one with the beast.\n\nRezyl let out an accepting sigh.\n\nThe creature walked like a man burdened by untold sin \u2013 lumbering and slow, though its stride covered ground with unnatural ease.\n\nTo Rezyl, the approaching horror cut an imposing silhouette not unlike that of an ancient, disgraced knight. \n\nMaybe it had been heroic once.\n\nMaybe here in these shadows, to the watchful eyes of the wicked woman and her rotting horde it was a hero still \u2013 only for a darker, sinister cause. \n\nThe thought intrigued Rezyl.\n\nThe fight he had come all this way to find, the enemy he had hoped was nothing but a legend\u2019s lie, seemed eager to greet him.\n\nHe smiled beneath his helm, then spun his Rose with a confident Hunter\u2019s twirl, before steadying his aim and fanning its hammer one more.\n\nThe angry bloom lit the dark.\n\nSix shots, center mass.\n\nRezyl\u2019s lead pinged off a sudden, shimmering wall of black. \n\nThe knight had conjured a protective barrier as if from nothing.\n\nUnable to comprehend the creature\u2019s arcane methods \u2013 dark magic or unimagined tech, or even a joining of the two, Rezyl didn\u2019t care. He reloaded and prepared to face the unknown.\n\nAs the ethereal shield faded the beast raised its blade and let loose an aggressive, inhuman roar: Hell\u2019s own battle cry.\n\nRezyl accepted the challenge.\n\nHis Rose gripped tightly in his vice grip, the Titan charged forward. \n\nHe would meet the shadow\u2019s rage head-on.\n\n\u2014- \n\nTwo days had passed since Rezyl stepped from the dark corridors beneath the moon, back into the light. His Ghost pressed him for details time and again. He wanted to know all he could of the wicked woman and her promise of suffering.\n\n\n\nOf the sea of mindless, chittering death.\n\nOf the hulking knight and Rezyl\u2019s epic battle.\n\nThe Ghost was enthralled and deeply concerned. If the monsters below the moon were active and aware, the City must be warned. Rezyl agreed.\n\nAs they watched another Earth-rise from the lonely quiet of the lunar surface and planned their long journey home, Rezyl pulled fragmented bone from the pouch that hung on his left hip: a reminder of the evil that lurked beyond the light, and the last remnants of the wicked woman\u2019s betrothed.\n\nAnd while he recounted once more the events of his time in the shadows he took his Rose from its holster and began grafting the bone to its steel frame \u2014 just another trophy, from another battle won.\n\n\u2014-\n\nIt was only later, and far too late, that the first whispers came and the bones revealed their true, jagged purpose.", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801101_d16c31e50dbe40c93a95b8e988093ddd.jpg"], "image_name": ["Legend: Rezyl Azzir - The Triumphant Fall"], "filename": ["801101_d16c31e50dbe40c93a95b8e988093ddd.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801101_d16c31e50dbe40c93a95b8e988093ddd.jpg", "path": "full/b9391628ebb5a74839761cd06732340a08ee2761.jpg", "checksum": "5bada459e34f1b3e7637100ea17ec637"}]},

Beneath it the Vandal\u2019s neck gave; a hiss of ether burst free before dissipating.\n\nRezyl turned. Three Dregs charged. Their Captain raised his shock blade high, unleashing a battle cry to fuel their courage.\n\nFocused fire spit from the muzzle of Rezyl\u2019s full-auto. The Dregs fell.\n\nTo the Captain, Rezyl was a trophy that would buy unmatched respect among his Devil brothers.\n\nTo Rezyl, the Captain was already an afterthought. As ether leaked from the pirate\u2019s broken body with each blow of Rezyl\u2019s heavy fists, Rezyl\u2019s attention had shifted to the unknown, but inevitable, battles to follow.\n\nThis was the state of things; conflict as common as breath.\n\n\u2014 The Tescan Valley Encounter \u2014\n\nA Ketch with unfamiliar markings hung low between two peaks. A rare sight. Fallen flagships weren\u2019t known to linger so close to the surface, preferring constant motion, like sharks on the hunt.\n\nSkiffs circled below the Ketch as their crews prepared to plunder any treasures the facility held.\n\nRezyl leveled his rocket launcher. A digital ping signaled a lock, and a trail of smoke shot toward the lead Skiff.\n\nTwo more rockets followed in rapid succession.\n\nThe lead Skiff took two hits, lurched and retreated back toward the Ketch above.\n\nThe third rocket caught a trailing Skiff as the craft turned to engage its attackers.\n\nRezyl looked back. \u201cGo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take a Ketch alone,\u201d Hassa laughed.\n\n\u201cThe ship isn\u2019t my target,\u201d Rezyl had a plan. Hassa hated Rezyl\u2019s plans with equal parts envy and concern.\n\n\u201cLead the Skiffs away,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet\u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t meet if you\u2019re dead,\u201d Tover shot back.\n\nRezyl smiled beneath his helm, \u201cGo.\u201d\n\nHassa and Tover throttled their Sparrows and disappeared into the heavy woods. Rezyl watched from cover as the Skiffs gave chase.\n\nThe Fallen below had taken defensive positions. The rocket attack caught them off guard but they were ready now, and there were more of them than he had time to count.\n\nRezyl raced down the slope, weaving between the thick growth of brush and pine, on a direct path for the Fallen clustered at the mountain\u2019s base, his Ghost at his side.\n\n\u201cI need you to hang back.\u201d\n\n\u201cUhhh...\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways have.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow quick can you light my spark?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou expect to die?

Eager Dregs rushed and were met with death as Rezyl marched forward.\n\nA massive blast cratered the ground a few feet from the Titan. The Ketch had turned its guns on Rezyl.\n\nAnother blast impacted to Rezyl\u2019s left and he stumbled. A third exploded directly in his path...\n\n...and Rezyl fell.\n\nFrom the treeline, his Ghost watched as the Fallen celebrated and a Skiff drifted down from the Ketch above.\n\nThe circle around Rezyl\u2019s body parted and the imposing figure of their Kell stepped forward to admire his prize.\n\nThe chittering excitement quieted to a steady drone as the Kell lifted Rezyl\u2019s limp body by the neck.\n\nA chorus rose among the crew, growing louder as the Kell hefted Rezyl over his head for all to see.\n\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost darted low through the crowd. He didn\u2019t like Rezyl\u2019s plan, but now he understood it.\n\nDistracted by their Kell\u2019s triumph, the Ghost\u2019s presence went unnoticed until a beam of light swept over Rezyl\u2019s body.\n\nThe mood shifted instantly, cheers turning to ravenous shouts.\n\nThe Kell\u2019s gaze fell to the Ghost as the beam faded.\n\nThe circle began to collapse \u2014 the Fallen set to pounce.\n\nAs the Kell moved to toss Rezyl aside, cold steel met the underside of the alien marauder\u2019s jaw, followed by a red flash as Rezyl pulled his cannon\u2019s trigger.\n\nEther spewed in an angry geyser and the Kell\u2019s grip loosened. Rezyl hit the ground and unloaded five more rounds into the Fallen leader\u2019s torso. The monster dropped.\n\nFrenzied, the Kell\u2019s crew closed in like a flood.\n\nRezyl\u2019s Ghost lifted above the fray, frantic, \u201cNow! Now! Now!\u201d\n\nIn one motion, Rezyl rose from a crouch, his fists clenched and raised high as a storm of Arc Light built within him, his full might raining down on the Kell\u2019s chest. The shockwave of Rezyl\u2019s attack hit like a meteor, shattering \n\nthe Kell\u2019s body and any Fallen within the Havoc storm\u2019s radius.\n\nThe remaining Fallen staggered, knocked back and dazed.\n\nRezyl triggered his Sparrow.\n\nHis Ghost flew to his side, \u201cWe leaving?\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore that Ketch opens up on us.\u201d\n\nRezyl punched the throttle as the Fallen crew opened fire.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s never do that again,\u201d his Ghost pleaded.\n\nRezyl didn\u2019t have to reply. If war was a constant, \u201cnever\u201d was just an illusion. \n\n\u2014 In Defense of North Channel \u2014\n\nWinds from the south caught the smoke and began to clear the thick air.\n\nSlowly, the citizens of the small, snow-covered settlement came out from their hiding places.\n\nRezyl surveyed their faces \u2014 each weary, but flecked with hope. \n\nLiving in the wilds was all they had known. Surviving. Fighting. Hiding. These people had heard stories of a safer place, but tales of a better life were so rarely true.\n\nRezyl and his companions had been tracking these Fallen for weeks. Had they caught them sooner this town would have been spared. That any survivors climbed from the rubble to see another day marked this as a victory, but Rezyl \n\nwas growing tired of small wins, however meaningful.\n\nThat evening, Rezyl and the others led a gathering of survivors on the long journey to the growing city beneath the Traveler. Some settlers remained behind, choosing to stake their claim in the untamed wilds.\n\nRezyl admired their resolve, but never looked back. He knew whatever death these brave pioneers avoided that day would come to them... someday... in one form or another.", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/790030_bed24e8d44dce16c9f52a48b815590b4.jpg"], "image_name": ["Rezyl Azzir - War Without End"], "filename": ["790030_bed24e8d44dce16c9f52a48b815590b4.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/790030_bed24e8d44dce16c9f52a48b815590b4.jpg", "path": "full/f653caa6a0ae0dfd56464917281caa3b565f16b2.jpg", "checksum": "10d1a8525512426e3e1da30bdd38e9d9"}]},

Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext time doesn\u2019t matter. You lost today, and today you owe me.\u201d\n\nThe Titan stared down at the Hunter, but said nothing, his hands clenched in fists. Cayde ignored the posturing and turned to face a desolate field of dirt and large rocks. A writhing mob of children spread across it, clusters of them barreling into each other as they bellowed and screamed. A much smaller number of elders waded in the chaotic sea of miniature people.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? What\u2019s happening?\u201d Shaxx demanded.\n\n\u201cThis City has children. Children who must stay within designated safe zones.\u201d The two Guardians watched as a boy climbed the largest rock on the field, about four feet in the air, and howled at the sky. \u201cOf course they\u2019re gonna go a little stir-crazy. Parents bring them out to this\u2014you\u2019d think it would have a name\u2014this field every month, and they have at it. Better they hit each other than climb the walls.\u201d\n\nShaxx stared at them.\n\n\u201cSo. You\u2019re going to pick two,\u201d Cayde said.\n\nShaxx looked down at him. \u201cPick two what?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo of the little brats. You\u2019ll pick a team of two, and you\u2019re going to train them in this... sport they play here. It\u2019s some kind of tournament. You know all about those.\u201d\n\nShaxx surveyed the field.\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the last time you\u2019re going to say that today, but you\u2019ve made your bed. Get comfy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can pay you Glimmer. Two Crucible matches\u2019 worth. Why waste my time on children?\u201d\n\nA child sped past and waved at Cayde as Shaxx spoke. Cayde responded with an upward thumb. \n\n\u201cI like bugging you. Plus, you\u2019d be surprised what goes on out here that only these little miscreants know about.\u201d\n\nBeneath the helmet, Shaxx stared holes into the Exo\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThey run very fast. Listen, I know you\u2019re going to be you, but try to keep them intact. I make sure a Guardian they know comes to visit them once in a while. You weren\u2019t the kids\u2019 first choice, or even their tenth, but you were the only one I could get leverage on this week.\u201d\n\nShaxx stood motionless, but his fury engulfed the air like a flame. Cayde turned to leave, his cloak billowing in the wind behind him. \u201cI\u2019m going to make so many Crucible bets while you\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Shaxx began, but Cayde was already lost in a departing crowd of adults.\n\nShaxx let out a breath, then scanned the field again, past child after squirming child. He quickly discerned the two on the field with the best athletic potential. Two human girls, snarling as they swung branches at each other, seemingly impervious to pain. He walked past them, through the crowd, and several elders paused just briefly enough in their youth wrangling to let their jaws hang. Lord Shaxx navigated the unruly sea with grace, and headed toward a lone tree in a corner of the field. An Awoken girl and a human boy sat huddled below it.\n\nAs Shaxx\u2019s shadow eclipsed them, they looked up at him with the same brightness in their eyes. \u201cWhat are your names?\u201d he demanded. \u201cRuna,\u201d said the Awoken with some disdain. She returned the blank stare of Shaxx\u2019s faceplate. \u201cMy name is Lonwabo,\u201d recited the human, more like a question than a statement.\n\n\u201cYou look bored, Runa,\u201d Shaxx observed. \u201cAnd you look worried, Lonwabo.\u201d He pointed at the boy, who scooted back, startled.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned that makes both of you more intelligent than all these other dregs,\u201d said the Titan. \u201cYou\u2019re with me. I need the rules of engagement.\u201d Shaxx stared at them, and they stared back. \u201cSomeone talk to me.\u201d\n\nThey both spoke at once, and Shaxx listened in silence as they talked over each other to explain the game: Teams of two launch orb projectiles at each other, and players struck are eliminated. If both players on a team are eliminated, the team is out of the tournament, and their chance to play on the field is over.\n\n\u201cWhat do you call this drill? Skirmish? Supremacy?\u201d Shaxx demanded.\n\n\u201cDodge ball,\u201d said Runa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work on the name. Follow my instructions, and I will lead you to victory.\u201d \n\nShaxx waved one of the adults over.\n\n\u201cLord\u2014Lord Shaxx?\u201d said the Exo male.\n\n\u201cShaxx is fine.\u201d Only Guardians owed him respect. \u201cFind my team a match. Sooner the better.\u201d\n\nShaxx brought Lonwabo and Runa to the field, and kneeled. His hands engulfed their shoulders like a pair of descending moons. \u201cMy friends. Should you be killed, others lesser than you will take your place. Don\u2019t fight for yourself. Fight for those poor fools.\u201d \n\nLonwabo opened his mouth as if to speak, but hiccupped instead.\n\nShaxx turned them both around to face the sun and the other team across the field. He kneeled so low that his face was level with theirs. The three stared at the opposition: two human boys, eyes glaring, fists balled in determination. Their elder stood behind them, her eyes wide as she recognized Lord Shaxx.\n\nRuna yawned and rubbed her face, trying to clear the sleep from it.\n\nShaxx whispered to his new charges. \u201cCrush them.\u201d", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801105_4ecd9d669532ebbfaf2f5f7242e4a5f4.jpg"], "image_name": ["Ghost Fragment: Lord Shaxx"], "filename": ["801105_4ecd9d669532ebbfaf2f5f7242e4a5f4.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801105_4ecd9d669532ebbfaf2f5f7242e4a5f4.jpg", "path": "full/df2b7b0491ba0269f3b604c7175110bc09478106.jpg", "checksum": "096defffe19f9d7d0fddeb2c5484165c"}]},
      {"title": "Ghost Fragment: Lord Shaxx 2", "content": "The morning turned to noon as the sky darkened with dodgeballs and filled with the battle cries of children.\n\nWhen it was over, Lonwabo had tears in his eyes, but he tried his best to stand straight. Runa had a bloody knee, and stared wordlessly at the winning team: the two snarling girls from earlier in the morning. The girls lifted an unrefined mass of plasteel, a makeshift trophy, over their heads, and they roared.\n\nShaxx stared up at the Traveler. It sat, buoyed by a mantle of clouds against a blue sky. It didn\u2019t seem to notice him.\n\n\u201cTell me what you\u2019ve learned,\u201d Shaxx said to Runa and Lonwabo, his faceplate fixed skyward.\n\nThey did, and spoke for a continuous three minutes. Shaxx nodded, slowly.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad?\u201d asked Lonwabo. His face brightened.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gained more from this than the victors,\u201d he replied. The three of them looked on as the two girls smashed the plasteel cluster into the dirt, and to the horror of all the other children, it shattered. Runa's eyes narrowed ever so slightly, a dodgeball gripped in her hands. Shaxx continued: \u201cVictory is key to survival. You need it. Need to fight for it. But it teaches nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that mean, in a way, we won?\u201d asked Lonwabo.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Shaxx looked down at him. \u201cNo, you were annihilated.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Lonwabo.\n\nRuna continued to stare at the shattered trophy, and the winning team. She slowly turned the dodgeball in her hand.\n\n\u201cLet this loss drive you,\u201d Shaxx said to both of them. \u201cBut the game is over. Your focus should be on what\u2019s to come.\u201d\n\nLonwabo stared down at his hands. \u201cI think...I think I'm going to read a book,\u201d he said, surprising himself as he uttered the words.\n\n\u201cWe all make our own choices,\u201d said Shaxx.\n\nRuna said nothing as Cayde strode up out of a shadow in the afternoon sun. \u201cEverything good?\u201d the Hunter asked Shaxx.\n\n\u201cDo I look like I care?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, buddy. The bet\u2019s fulfilled. You don\u2019t have to pout. Just remember not to challenge a Hunter with Golden Guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can and I will. Rematch. End of day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on. I hope you\u2019re ready to babysit \u2018til the next Dawning\u2014\u201c \n\nRuna\u2019s ball struck Cayde in the neck: a stealth attack taught to her earlier in the morning.

      {"title": "Ghost Fragment: Eris Morn", "content": "The Tower\u2019s med bay was still. Guardians might operate across the system at all hours but even in the heart of the Last City, there is sometimes... quiet.\n\nThe Awoken man lay upon the bed like a broken thing. Machines monitored his every twitch, every aspect of his physical status. The steady, quiet blip of his heartbeat was the dominant sound in the room. \n\nA small transplex window sat in one wall of the room. Hovering there, eerily still, was a Ghost. Its single eye reflected against the inside of the window, a steady red glow.\n\nIn the corner of the room sat a chair. Cheap, vinyl-covered, this chair could have been a relic from the Golden Age itself. And, suddenly, it creaked.\n\nBecause, in the stillness, there was another measured source of breathing in the room. \n\nEris Morn settled back into the chair, allowing the dark wisps of power she\u2019d summoned to effortlessly flow from her back into the night. The green emanations from her shroud were stark against the dimness.\n\nAlmost as an afterthought, the Ghost turned from regarding the window. For a moment, three eyes stared at one, before it turned back to its watch.\n\nHer face implacable, Eris regarded the Awoken in the bed. \n\nHis name was Asher Mir.\n\nIrascible. Annoying. Cantankerous. She\u2019d even seen Ikora Rey become... exasperated in his presence. Her lips quirked, very slightly, upwards. A kindred spirit, if she\u2019d ever had one.\n\nHer smile died as her gaze slid to his side. His Warlock garb had been stripped from his body, and she could see his pale blue chest as it rose and fell in the bed. His arm. His arm was gone.\n\nIn its place was a thing. The point where mechanicals knit with flesh was ghastly to behold, but the design was unmistakable to any Guardian who\u2019d been in the field: Asher Mir\u2019s arm was that of a Vex construct.\n\nHer eyes flicked to the ghost at the window. It too, was transformed. The unmistakable outline of Vex technology encrusting and penetrating the small warden\u2019s shell. That red, staring eye...\n\nShe stood, and stepped to the side of the bed.\n\nHer voice was gentle, quiet, but its timbre filled the still air of the room. \n\n\u201cI am leaving, my old friend.\u201d\n\nThe man in the bed did not stir.\n\n\u201cSoon I will take my leave of this\u201d\u2014she put her hands up, to take in the med bay, the City, the Tower, Earth\u2014\u201clie.\u201d\n\nShe placed a gloved hand on the back of his blue, flesh-and-bone hand. \u201cI wish we could have spoken, you and I, one last time. But my story here is done. I have avenged those I lost. I must find...\u201d\n\nShe stopped, and beneath the gauze on her face all three eyes closed. For a moment she allowed herself to feel the dark tears that flowed, unending, down her face. The eyes reopened, and her strength blazed in the darkness.\n\n\u201cI must find a new path through the night. The Hive are vast, and ancient. A power from far beyond our realm. If we are ever truly to face them, ever truly to put an end to their hate, I must step beyond the safety of the City.\u201d\n\nShe lifted her head and looked beyond the window to the horizon. To the grand sweep of the Walls, the edge of humanity\u2019s reach.\n\n\u201cBe safe, Gensym Scribe. A storm is coming. And I will not be at your side when it finds its way to our shores.\u201d\n\nWith those words, and a gathered locus of power, she was gone. \n\nThe room returned to stillness. The blip of the Awoken man\u2019s heart echoed from the machines. And the Ghost stared into the night, its red eye never blinking.", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801108_b49e96efe5dc4c436260af44ab1d9d94.jpg"], "image_name": ["Ghost Fragment: Eris Morn"], "filename": ["801108_b49e96efe5dc4c436260af44ab1d9d94.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/801108_b49e96efe5dc4c436260af44ab1d9d94.jpg", "path": "full/5efb86c8312c6dbe8e2b78f79f120eba7104a55b.jpg", "checksum": "1dc8c4063103f4de3ea3afc4a50fae1a"}]},

We won.\n\nCommander, I\u2019m not even sure they\u2019re flying the banners anymore.

He slumped, and the toes of his scuffed boots bumped over the stones and left trails in the dust. He kept his eyes low, a ragged and stained cloak hanging over his face. It was not a position to which he was accustomed. \n\nThey debased him. They abused him. He bit the inside of his cheek until the blood filled his mouth. He struggled not to resist. \n\nThey needed to believe he was broken. That he wasn\u2019t a threat. \n\nIt was the only way they would bring him before their kell. \n\nHe\u2019d spent weeks weaving the illusion that led the Fallen to him. He\u2019d left bits of his trail where they couldn\u2019t help but find them. He skulked from planet to planet\u2014Mars, then Venus, then Mercury, then back again\u2014following rumors and whispers.

He\u2019d let everything they had built fall apart, while those still loyal to him searched every inch of this forsaken system. \n\nNow it was time to stop searching and start building. \n\nHe would need soldiers who answered to him and no one else.

      {"title": "Lord Radegast", "content": "Radegast strode through the ashes. A cloud hung in his wake as he made his way to the top of the rise. Scars marred his armor, and his sidearm lay in the dust. He didn't need it, now. The battle was over.\n\nThis had been a mining outpost, once. A few buildings and a transport. Nestled amid a small forest, it had been like a precious jewel set atop the dull crown of the wildlands.\n\nNow there was almost nothing left. The warrior began to walk slowly down into the valley. He pulled his helm from his head and let it drop with a muted thud into the ash. Of the forest, only stumps remained. Of the small village there was no trace; the buildings reduced to splinters. Here and there you could see dull gray signs of inhabitation.\n\nAt the bottom of the valley, Radegast came to the source of the ash, death, and violence. The Light-bearers were laid out in a row, simple cloth covering their armored and robed forms. There were five of them, and they had been lined up beneath the melted girders of the settlement's great hall. \n\nThese warlords had terrorized this part of the wilds for years. Hundreds had died at their hands. \n\nRadegast turned as his companions crossed the valley floor to join him. They had been policing the dead, finding a fitting end for the settlers and miners of the outpost. Jolder came with a steady glide, energy and fire. Saladin, calm and slow, the weight of the dead on his shoulders. In formation behind them stepped Perun, her boots barely leaving a trace as she walked. They gathered before him.\n\n\"Never again.\" He intoned the words quietly. The others stood as battle-scarred statues. \n\n\"We ride against despots and warlords. We hide in these enclaves, hoping that other Light-bearers will not find us. We fear each other.\" He shook his head, his fists clenched. \n\n\"And we should not. We are stronger, together. We are mighty, together. All we have to fear is... this.\" He pointed down at the dead warlords. \"Giving in. Allowing the power of the Light to blind us to what we truly are.\"\n\nIt was Perun, of course, who asked the question. \"What are we?\" No judgment. No reproach. \n\nStill, Radegast could feel their doubt. He turned upwards, and his eyes settled on the massive span that supported the hall. His eyes shone as he turned back to his fellows.\n\n\"We will be what the people need us to be. We will be guardians. We will be protectors. We will hold the last of us together.\"\n\nHis voice rang out across the still valley. \"Our days of hiding are ended. Say it now, each of you. Who among the other bearers do you trust? Who can be counted on to ride with us?\"\n\n\"Bretomart,\u201d said Jolder.\n\n\"Deidris,\" said Perun.\n\n\"I trust only you, Radegast,\" said Saladin, and their leader scowled in response.\n\n\"What are you saying? What are we?\" Perun asked again.\n\nRadegast smiled. \"We will gather those you trust. We will not wait for this\"\u2014he gestured around him\u2014 \"to force our hand. We will ride against those that would use the Light against our own. Humanity must have protectors. Like the knights of old.\"\n\nAround them, the dust swirled in the air. Shafts of sunlight coalesced in long slanted bars as the sun dipped towards the horizon. \n\n\"Are you with me? Will you stand with me\u2014 as Iron Lords?\"\n\nIn the waning light, their answers rang like thunder on the air.", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800410_410fd5973a20619e77af51e095a6b39e.jpg"], "image_name": ["Lord Radegast"], "filename": ["800410_410fd5973a20619e77af51e095a6b39e.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800410_410fd5973a20619e77af51e095a6b39e.jpg", "path": "full/de3be20d72b3e9c5962cbf12776f07a940881182.jpg", "checksum": "6a93fcc5119f66bd464f30a842b3f915"}]},

The castle entrance is a wrought-iron portcullis flanked by two motion-sensing turrets. In the valley below, just out of the turrets' range, rests a gold-and-gray transport ship. The symbol of the Iron Lords shines with an otherworldly glow on its folded wings. </i>\n<i>The Iron Lords have come to challenge Warlord Rience.</i>\n<i>Two Sparrows skim lightly over the grass as they head toward the ship, the castle at their backs.</i><i>Perun and Radegast dismount.</i><i>They nod to each other wordlessly, and part.</i>\n\nPerun walked up the ship\u2019s gangplank and made straight for Jolder's room. She hit the door controls and stepped inside.\n\n\"I'm almost ready,\" Jolder said, before Perun could speak. \n\nJolder stood next to a chest full of weapons, armor and other gear. She flashed Perun a bright smile as she cinched the straps of her gold-and-white cuirass.\n\nThe corners of Perun's mouth twitched. \"I came to tell you Rience agreed to the single combat. Guess I don\u2019t need to.\u201d\n\nJolder smiled. \"I figured he would. Your plans have a way of working out.\"\n\nPerun leaned against the doorframe. \"Saladin and Efrideet both volunteered to be your second.\"\n\n\"Hm.\" Jolder took a pair of gauntlets out of the chest and put them on. \"Saladin's better at staying calm under pressure.\"\n\n\"We need a second, it's \u2018cause you're dead. No one will be calm.\"\n\n\"Right. Efrideet, then. She fights better when she's angry.\" Jolder tightened the straps of her gauntlets, then made a fist. \"Hold this?\" She handed Perun a shield, golden and reflective as a mirror. \n\nPerun rolled her eyes, but held the shield up, front toward Jolder.\n\nJolder took a small pot of black liquid and a thin brush out of the chest, then stood in front of the shield and began lining her left eye with kohl. \"Who\u2019re they sending?\"\n\n\"Melig.\"\n\n\"Do you know that, or do you just <i>know</i>?\"\n\n\"Just know,\" Perun said. \"Rience will figure we send you. So, how to respond? He thinks bigger is better. So, Melig.\" \n\nJolder smiled. \"Tell Rience he can send two. Otherwise\u2014\" Jolder finished the line of kohl with a flick of her wrist, leaving a sharp black wing at the corner of her eye. \"My battle-paint will be for nothing.\"\n\nPerun chuckled drily, without smiling. \"Not the best tactical move.\"\n\n\"But it'd be more fun.\"\n\nPerun grunted.\n\nJolder arched her brow, her right eye half-painted, and looked over the shield rim at Perun. \"What are you thinking?\"\n\nPerun ran a hand through her close-cropped hair. \"Don\u2019t know yet. Seems... too easy. I were Rience, I'd be thinking about poison, neurojammers... Man like him with nothing to lose, might even target your Ghost.\"\n\n\"Perun.\" Jolder took the shield from Perun's arms and placed a gauntleted hand on Perun's shoulder. Her eyes flashed between lines of thick black kohl as she smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d \n\nPerun sighed, then placed her hand over Jolder's. \"True.\u201d \n\nJolder slung her shield across her back, tucked her helmet under her arm, and hefted her enormous battle-axe casually over one armored shoulder. In her full battle harness, she towered over Perun, the plates of her gold-and-white armor gleaming in the dim light. \n\n\"All right,\" Jolder smiled. \"I'm ready.\"", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800415_ac0345ac346c7c29cf43e99ebcca33e0.jpg"], "image_name": ["Lady Jolder"], "filename": ["800415_ac0345ac346c7c29cf43e99ebcca33e0.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800415_ac0345ac346c7c29cf43e99ebcca33e0.jpg", "path": "full/e2437ad13c1addc0a051db0d0f122f152a263d18.jpg", "checksum": "9ea5149571719f7347096e9bccfebd43"}]},

A polished obsidian table rested heavily between them.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d have the courage to come back here,\u201d said the Warlord.\n\n\u201cSituational awareness. Not courage. I go where I can do the most good. Thank you for seeing me.\u201d Felwinter\u2019s voice sounded as hollow as his helmet. Citan wanted to knock it clean off the Iron Lord\u2019s bony shoulders. He could do it with a single punch.\n\n\u201cAs I recall, you used to have a throne on that Light-forsaken peak, \u2018til you joined up with the wolves.

Over and over again if we have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI invite you to my home after you abandon us, and you come to threaten me?\u201d The Warlord stood, towering over Felwinter.\n\n\u201cTo broker peace.\u201d Citan thought that even the voice behind the helmet didn\u2019t believe what it said. The floor shuddered as the Warlord upended the massive table with one hand. It smashed into the opposite wall, as tendrils of Void Light passed through it and coalesced into Felwinter\u2019s leaping form.\n\nCitan had seen this parlor trick before, and judged that he could hammer the Iron Lord out of the air\u2014\n\nBut Felwinter\u2019s momentum continued into a knee-lift that smashed into Citan\u2019s head as the larger man reared back to strike. The Warlord fell, the front of his helm shattering. Felwinter landed next to Citan\u2019s prone body.\n\n\u201cLady Jolder taught me that. I can\u2019t say the Iron Lords haven\u2019t done me any favors,\u201d the voice intoned. \n\n\u201cYou know we\u2019ll burn the world down before we let the Iron Lords rule it,\u201d the larger man gasped, breathing out of his mouth, his face a bloody mess. The Void Light in Felwinter\u2019s hand snapped\u2014and so did the Warlord\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cRadegast is scattered. Perun is indecisive. Silimar wants to build a tower and hide. But they\u2019re going to change the world; no one can stop them,\u201d Felwinter said quietly to the corpse. He parted his coat and drew a bronze shotgun. \u201cWill it be for the better? I don\u2019t know. But they mean to end the fighting, so I don\u2019t have to sleep with my back to the wall every night, Light in my hand. And that\u2019s not nothing.\u201d\n\nHe paused, as if waiting for something.\n\n\u201cNormally, this is where I ask you to reconsider. Tell you that you should come with me. See how powerful your Light can become. But I know you, Citan. What you do with the land you take, with its people. The other Lords\u2014especially Saladin\u2014might let you walk away. I\u2019m not going to give them the chance.\u201d\n\nCitan\u2019s Ghost sparked into view from above, bringing its eye to bear on its fallen charge. The Warlord emerged from a radiant column, a frenzied shout at his lips.\n\nFelwinter\u2019s shotgun cracked like thunder\u2014once for the Warlord, and again for his Ghost.", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800412_e22449f1788ce4dee7d90efbcd0920b3.jpg"], "image_name": ["Lord Felwinter"], "filename": ["800412_e22449f1788ce4dee7d90efbcd0920b3.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800412_e22449f1788ce4dee7d90efbcd0920b3.jpg", "path": "full/e70a26d18b3a5046d51bad92223b13b0d33bf505.jpg", "checksum": "741472818dc4ce08e330d937e3bce77c"}]},

The scavenged pieces of an Ahamkara, several jumbled coyote skeletons, and a fossil mastodon skull are mixed in with them. The bones are scorched and battered from the various grenades, bullets, and hammers he's taken to them.

But they dug in their heels, and the shields held. \n\n\"Return fire!\"\n\nTrapped in the narrow path, Segoth and his warriors fell one by one. \n\nPerun, Radegast, and Saladin reloaded and then Segoth was up again, his glowing Ghost at his shoulder. He fired wildly, and a bullet struck Radegast in the head. \n\n\"Got him!\" Perun shouted as Radegast collapsed.\n\n\"Covering you!\" Saladin returned. \n\nPerun, Radegast, and Saladin died many more times than any one of Segoth's men. But any time one of them fell, another would cover them until they staggered to their feet again. The shield wall held. The three gave no ground. \n\nFinally, his robes singed and ragged, Segoth signaled a retreat. \n\n\u201cIron Wolves!\u201d he shouted as his warriors scattered and a cheer went up from the people in the silver ruins. \u201cI will slaughter everyone who has ever sheltered you!\"\n\nIn answer, Perun shot him again.", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800411_c6a1a7a3af9ddb3eb520c6bf9e81de78.jpg"], "image_name": ["Lady Perun"], "filename": ["800411_c6a1a7a3af9ddb3eb520c6bf9e81de78.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/800411_c6a1a7a3af9ddb3eb520c6bf9e81de78.jpg", "path": "full/47c3f038ab70e295e47e9997f83156726c819713.jpg", "checksum": "7c37de30905c211e5754dc7e9e02895d"}]},

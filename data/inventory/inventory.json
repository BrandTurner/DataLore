That a lost Guardian’s weapon was altered by the Hive in an attempt to fuse their own dark understanding with humanity’s mastery of war. The result was a weapon that would feed on its owner’s aggression—reaching further when angry eyes drew focus, its hunger rising as it tore through bone and flesh.\n\n Any Guardian who comes across the weapon must ask some very simple questions with endlessly complicated answers: Is your Light bright enough to stand, even briefly, in full gaze of the Hive's abyss? Can it handle what has died and been reborn in those shadows?",

          "It was the fourth night of the seventh moon.\n\n Nine rises since any sign.\n\n Trail wasn't cold, but lukewarm would've been an exaggeration.\n\n Jaren had us hold by a ravine.\n\n The heavy wood along the cliffs' edge caught the wind, holding back the cold and the rush of water muffled our conversation.\n\n We'd seen dual Skiffs hanging low as they cut through the valley.\n\n Wasn't known Fallen territory, but anymore that's a dangerous assumption.\n\n There were six of us then.\n\n Three less than two moons prior, but still, one more than when we'd first turned our backs to Palamon's ash.\n\n We took a rotation for watch during the night.\n\n Movement was kept to a minimum and communication was down to hand signals and simple gestures.\n\n We could hold our own in a fight, but only the dead went looking for one—a hard truth that cut in direct opposition to our reasons for being so far from anything resembling civilization, much less our safety.\n\n The Skiffs had spooked Kressler and Nada, and, in truth, me as well. But, looking back, I think we were all just grasping for any good reason to turn back.\n\n Not because we would—turn back—but because it seemed to be our only real hope, and I think we all knew it.\n\n Forward. Where we were headed—into the unknown. And following the footsteps we were. It all just started to feel like a never-ending dead end after a while.\n\n Jaren never wavered though. Not once.\n\n At least not to any noticeable degree.\n\n It was his drive, his conviction, that kept us going.\n\n And—it's hard to think on—but if I'm honest, it was his death that rekindled my own fire. A fire that was all but exhausted on that cold night.\n\n He seemed confident we were close.\n\n But more than confident—sure. He seemed sure.\n\n No one else felt it—our own confidence, and any enthusiasm we'd had was set to wither soon as Brevin, Trenn and Mel were gunned down.\n\n The Ghost—Jaren's Ghost—never said a word to any of us. Just hung there. Always alert. Always judging. Not us, per se, but the moment. Any moment.\n\n I never got the sense it thought of us as lesser. More that it was guarded, wary.\n\n We knew it could speak. We'd overheard them a few times. Just brief words, and no one ever pressed the subject.\n\n From time to time I caught its gaze lingering on me, but always assumed the attention was a result of the bond Jaren and I had. He was a father to me. At the time I didn't know why he'd singled me out as someone to care for. Someone to protect. After all the loss, I welcomed it, but looking back—taking in the arm's length at which he kept the others—I guess I should've known, or at least suspected there was more to it.\n\n We all woke that night, closer to morning than the previous day.\n\n A crack of gunfire split through the wood. Then more.\n\n Far off, but near enough to pump the blood.\n\n A familiar ring. 'Last Word.' Jaren's sidearm. His best friend.<br> Then another. A single shot, an unmistakable echo calling through the night. Hushed, cutting.\n\n One shot, dark and infernal. Followed by silence.\n\n We crouched low and quiet. Listening. Hoping.\n\n Jaren was gone. Off on his own.\n\n Maybe we were closer than we'd allowed ourselves to believe.\n\n Too close.\n\n He'd gone to face death alone.\n\n I couldn't admit it—not at the time—but he thought he was <br> protecting us.\n\n After such a long road—years on its heels, a trail littered with suffering and fire—maybe he just couldn't take the thought of anymore dead kids, as he called us.\n\n The echoes faded and we all held still. No way to track the direction. No sense in rushing blind.\n\n What was done was done.\n\n The cadence of the shots fired told a story none of us cared to hear.\n\n 'Last Word' it hadn't been. And somewhere in the world, close enough for us to bear absent witness but far enough to be a dream, Jaren Ward lay dead or dying. And there was nothing to be done.\n\n Hours passed. An eternity.\n\n We held our spot, but as the sun rose the others began to fade back into the world. Without Jaren there was nothing holding us together. No driving force. Vengeance had grown stale as a motivator. Fear and a longing to see more suns rise drove a wedge between duty and desire.\n\n By midday I was alone. I couldn't leave. Wouldn't.\n\n Either I would find Jaren and set him at ease, or the other would find me and that would be a fitting end.\n\n Death marching on.\n\n But then, a motion. Quick and darting. My muscles tensed and my hand shot to the grip of my leadslinger.\n\n Then a confirmation of the horrible truth I had already accepted, as Jaren's Ghost came to a halt a few paces in front of me.\n\n I exhaled and slumped forward. Still standing, but broken.<br> The tiny Light looked me over with a curious tilt to its axis, then shot a beam of light over my body. Scanning me as it had done the very first time we met.\n\n I looked up. Staring into its singular glowing eye.\n\n And it spoke...",

The facts won't sync with the reality, but they'll be close, and there's no one to say otherwise, so for all intents and purposes, this will be the history of a settlement we called Palamon and the horrors that followed an all too brief peace.\n\n I remember home, and stories of a paradise we'd all get to see some day - of a City, 'shining even in the night.' Palamon didn't shine, but it was sanctuary, of a sort. \n\n We'd settled in the heart of a range that stretched the horizon. Wooded mountains that shot with purpose toward the sky. Winters were harsh, but the trees and peaks hid us from the world. We talked about moving on, sometimes, striking out for the City. But it was just a longing.\n\n Drifters came and went. On occasion they would stay, but rarely. <br> We had no real government, but there was rule of law. Basic tenets agreed upon by all and eventually overseen by Magistrate Loken.\n\n And there you have it...no government, until there was. I was young, so I barely understood. I remember Loken as a hardworking man who just became broken. Mostly I think he was sad. Sad and frightened. As his fingers tightened on Palamon, people left. Those who stayed saw our days became grey. Loken's protection - from the Fallen, from ourselves - became dictatorial. \n\n Looking back, I think maybe Loken had just lost too much - of himself, his family. But everyone lost something. And some of us had nothing to begin with. My only memory of my parents is a haze, like a daydream, and a small light, like the spark of their souls. It's not anything I dwell on. They left me early, taken by Dregs.\n\n Palamon raised me from there. The family I call my own - called my own - cared for me as if I was their natural born son. And life was good. Being the only life I knew, my judgment is skewed, and it wasn't easy - pocked by loss as it was - but I would call it good.\n\n Until, of course, it wasn't.\n\n Until two men entered my world. One a light. The other the darkest shadow I would ever know.",

Maybe none of us had. He'd said he was only passing through, and I believed him - still do, but life can get in the way of intent, and often does.\n\n I can picture that day with near perfect clarity. Of all the details though - every nuance, every moment - the memory that sticks in my mind is the iron on Jaren's hip. A cannon that looked both pristine and lived in. Like a relic of every battle he'd ever fought, hung low at his waist - a trophy and a warning.\n\n This man was dangerous, but there was a light about him - a pureness to his weight - that seemed to hint that his ire was something earned, not carelessly given.\n\n I'd been the first to see him as he approached, but soon most of Palamon had turned out to greet him. My father held me back as everyone stood in silence.\n\n Jaren didn't make a sound behind his sleek racer's helmet. He looked just like the heroes in the stories, and to this day I'm not sure one way or the other if the silence between the town's people and the adventurer was born of fear or respect. I like to think the latter, but any truth I try to place on the moment would be of my own making.\n\n As we waited for Magistrate Loken to arrive and make an official greeting, my patience got the best of me. I shook free of my father's heavy hand and made the short sprint across the court, stopping a few paces from where this new curiosity stood - a man unlike any other.\n\n I stared up at him and he lowered his attention to me, his eyes hidden behind the thick tinted visor of his headgear. My sight quickly fell to his sidearm. I was transfixed by it. I imagined all the places that weapon had been. All of the wonders it had seen. The horrors it had endured. My imagination darted from one heroic act to the next.\n\n I barely registered when he began to kneel, holding out the iron as if an offering. But my eyes locked onto the piece, mesmerized. \n\n I recall turning back to my father and seeing the looks on the faces of everyone I knew. There was worry there - my father slowly shaking his head as if pleading with me to ignore the gift. \n\n I turned back to the man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, the finest Hunter this system may ever know and one of the greatest Guardians to ever defend the Traveler's Light...\n\n And I took the weapon in my hand. Carefully. Gently.\n\n Not to use. But to observe. To imagine. To feel its weight and know its truth.\n\n That was the first time I held 'Last Word, but, unfortunately, not the last.",

Tracking Fallen, after the bandits had caused a stir.\n\n The stranger – the other – arrived the following day.\n\n He rarely spoke. Took a room. Took our hospitality.\n\n I was intrigued by him, as I was Jaren when he’d first arrived.\n\n But the stranger was cold. Distant. Damaged, I thought.\n\n But I wasn’t afraid. Not yet.\n\n Only a child, I knew the monsters of our world to walk like men, but they were not. They were something alien. Four-armed and savage.\n\n The stranger was polite, but solemn.\n\n I took him for a sad, broken man, and he was. Though, at the time, I didn’t understand how that could make one dangerous.\n\n As with Jaren, father made an effort to keep me away from the stranger.\n\n It wouldn’t matter.\n\n As the silhouette approached, fear held tight.\n\n The dark figure towered over me. Looking into me – through me.\n\n He smiled. My knees weak.

Tracking Fallen, after the bandits had caused a stir.\n\n The stranger – the other – arrived the following day.\n\n He rarely spoke. Took a room. Took our hospitality.\n\n I was intrigued by him, as I was Jaren when he’d first arrived.\n\n But the stranger was cold. Distant. Damaged, I thought.\n\n But I wasn’t afraid. Not yet.\n\n Only a child, I knew the monsters of our world to walk like men, but they were not. They were something alien. Four-armed and savage.\n\n The stranger was polite, but solemn.\n\n I took him for a sad, broken man, and he was. Though, at the time, I didn’t understand how that could make one dangerous.\n\n As with Jaren, father made an effort to keep me away from the stranger.\n\n It wouldn’t matter.\n\n As the silhouette approached, fear held tight.\n\n The dark figure towered over me. Looking into me – through me.\n\n He smiled. My knees weak. All lost.\n\n Then, he turned and walked away.\n\n Leaving ruin and a heartbroken, terrified boy in his wake without a second glance.\n\n I’ve been chasing that stranger’s shadow ever since.\n\n<br><i>Now.</i>\n\n We stood silent, the sun high.\n\n Seconds passed, feeling more like hours.\n\n He looked different.\n\n He seemed, now, to be weightless – effortless in an existence that would crush a man burdened by conscience.\n\n My gaze remained locked as I felt a heat rising inside of me.<br> The other spoke...\n\n “Been awhile.”\n\n I gave no reply.\n\n “The gunslinger’s sword... his cannon.

          "The noble man stood. And the people looked to him. For he was a beacon - hope given form, yet still only a man. And within that truth there was great promise. If one man could stand against the night, then so too could anyone - everyone.\n\n In his strong hand the man held a Rose. And his aura burned bright.\n\n When the man journeyed on, the people remembered. In his wake hope spread. But the man had a secret fear. His thoughts were dark. A sadness crept from the depths of his being. He had been a hero for so long, but pride had led him down sorrow's road.\n\n Slowly the shadows' whisper became a voice, a dark call, offering glories enough to make even the brightest Light wander. He knew he was fading, yet he still yearned.\n\n On his last day he sat and watched the sun fall. His final thoughts, pure of mind, if not body, held to a fleeting hope - though they would suffer for the man he would become, the people would remember him as he had been.\n\n And so the noble man hid himself beneath a darkness no flesh should touch, and gave up his mortal self to claim a new birthright. Whether this was choice, or destiny, is a truth known only to fate.\n\n In that cool evening air, as dusk was devoured by night, the noble man ceased to exist. In his place another stood. \n\n Same meat. Same bone. But so very different.\n\n The first and only of his family. The sole forbearer and last descendent of the name Yor.\n\n In his first moments as a new being, he looked down at his Rose and realized for the first time that it held no petals: only the jagged purpose of angry thorns.",

The cleansing of your shadow and a return to the Light.<br> [silence]<br> [u.2:2.9] Why’d you pick me?<br> [u.1:2.9] It doesn’t work that way.<br> [u.2:3.0] Was I special?<br> [u.1:3.0] You were.<br> [u.2:3.1] But only as special as any other.<br> [u.1:3.1] You are all special.<br> [u.2:3.2] Seems to contradict the word don’t it.<br> [u.1:3.2] Not in my estimation.<br> [u.2:3.3] If we’re all special, are any of us special?<br> [u.1:3.3] Is that what you want? To be special?<br> [u.2:3.4] Heh.<br> [u.1:3.4] You dismiss, but it’s a very serious question. Is that all you’re after? Is all of the death worth that badge?<br> [u.2:3.5] Am I not already more than the rest?<br> [u.1:3.5] Looking at you here, now. The smoke, ash and bone at your feet mark you as so much less.<br> [u.2:3.6] Maybe. And yet here you are.<br> [u.1:3.6] Meaning?<br> [u.2:3.7] You have been at my side every step of the way.<br> [u.1:3.7] Where else would I be?<br> [u.2:3.8] Yet you disagree so thoroughly with my change in perspective.<br> [u.1:3.8] If only the change was simply one of perspective. Your “evolution” was no choice. This is not you having come to an understanding after careful considered thought. This is corruption.<br> [u.2:3.9] The shadows?<br> [u.1:3.9] The Darkness.<br> [u.2:4.0] Maybe so.<br> [u.1:4.0] There is no maybe here.<br> [u.2:4.1] And you think you can save me?<br> [u.1:4.1] I rekindled your Light, it falls first to me to aid in its survival.<br> [silence]<br> [u.2:4.2] I tire of it.<br> [u.1:4.2] You must try...<br> [u.2:4.3] I tire of you.<br> [u.1:4.3] [REDACTED]...<br> [u.2:4.4] That is no longer my name.<br> [u.1:4.4] I will not speak the other.<br> [u.2:4.5] It doesn’t matter. This is where we part ways.<br> [u.1:4.5] I will not leave you.<br> [u.2:4.6] I am leaving you.<br> [u.1:4.6] Without me, your journey ahead will be more than any one Guardian can handle.<br> [u.2:4.7] That’s the point. It’s been sometime since you saw me as worthy of walking among those I once called brother and sister. Yet... anymore, I feel as though I am worthy of so much more.<br> [u.1:4.7] Without me... You will die.<br> [u.2:4.8] Someday. Won’t be the first time.<br> [silence]<br> [u.2:4.9] Consider this my last good deed. I am releasing you of the burden of my deeds, both done and yet to come.<br> [u.1:4.8] I will not abandon you.<br> [u.2:5.0] You will. Or I will carve the Light from your shell and leave the carcass of my first and last friend in the dirt of this dull, red world for no one to find.<br> [u.1:4.9] Then I’ve failed you, completely.<br> [u.2:5.1] Not me. Maybe the man I was.<br> [u.1:5.0] He is truly dead.<br> [u.2:5.2] I believe so.<br> [u.1:5.1] Belief is not fact.<br> [u.2:5.3] Semantics I no longer have the patience for.<br> [silence]<br> [u.2:5.4] When you speak of me, use my proper name. Tell them of the man that stands before you, not the ghost of the hero I once was.<br> [u.1:5.2] You will always be [REDACTED] to me.<br> [u.2:5.5] If you cannot let that man go, you will forever taint his legacy. All the good I have ever done will be washed away in the fire of who I have become.<br> [u.1:5.3] If you care, there is still some promise within you.<br> [u.2:5.6] If I am being honest, I care only to give hope to the frightened, huddled masses so that when I come upon them they will have more to lose. Their pain will be greater. Their screams more pure. <br> [u.1:5.4] You...<br> [u.2:5.7] Nothing dies like hope. I cherish it. <br> [u.1:5.5] You’re a monster.<br> [u.2:5.8] Finally, you see the truth.<br> [u.1:5.6] [REDACTED] is truly dead.<br> [u.2:5.9] So I’ve said. Long live Dredgen Yor.<br> [u.1:5.7] This is farewell, but you can only run from your sins so far. In the end, you will die alone.<br> [u.2:6.0] Maybe so. But I gotta tell ya... I tend to like my odds.<br> [u.1:5.8] Your tainted “Rose” will not always save you.<br> [u.2:6.1] Old friend... It already has.",

He was right, and, had we met earlier, so too would you be.<br> [u.1:0.6] You’d dare defend yourself – all you’ve done – as anything but monstrous?<br> [u.2:0.6] No more than a hurricane.<br> [u.1:0.7] Then you’re a force of nature?<br> [u.2:0.7] I am all that is right. You may not see it – for lack of looking, or blind ignorance – but I am all that is good.<br> [u.1:0.8] You’ve just murdered a good man.<br> [u.2:0.8] He shot first.<br> [u.1:0.9] Yet you stand.<br> [u.2:0.9] Guess he missed.<br> [u.1:1.0] He never misses.<br> [u.2:1.0] First time for everything.<br> [silence]<br> [u.2:1.1] His cannon? Nice piece of hardware.<br> [u.2:1.2] Well-worn, but clean. Smooth hammer.<br> [u.1:1.1] It was his prize.<br> [u.2:1.3] Guess he put too much faith in the wrong steel.<br> [u.1:1.2] Is that where your faith lies, in steel?<br> [u.2:1.4] Not for some time. My steel is only an extension. My faith is in the shadow.<br> [u.1:1.3] Then my Light is an affront to all you are. I am your truest enemy.<br> [u.2:1.5] One of many.<br> [u.1:1.4] Would you end me?<br> [u.2:1.6] Not you. Not now.<br> [u.1:1.5] The shadow knows mercy.<br> [u.2:1.7] The shadow knows no such thing.<br> [u.1:1.6] Then what?<br> [u.2:1.8] The other.<br> [u.1:1.7] What other?<br> [u.2:1.9] The dead man’s charge.<br> [u.1:1.8] The boy?<br> [u.1:1.9] You’d end him as well?<br> [u.2:2.0] If it comes to that... We’ll see.<br> [u.1:2.0] I won’t let you have the child.<br> [u.2:2.1] Been long enough now, think maybe he’s a man.<br> [u.1:2.1] You cannot have him.<br> [u.2:2.2] Not yet.<br> [u.1:2.2] I won’t let you.<br> [u.2:2.3] That you could stop me is an amusing thought.<br> [silence]<br> [u.2:2.4] Here.<br> [silence]<br> [u.2:2.5] Take it.<br> [u.1:2.3] Why?<br> [u.2:2.6] Give the apprentice his master’s “sword.” It is a gift.<br> [u.1:2.4] You cannot have him.<br> [u.2:2.7] You fear for his Light?<br> [u.1:2.5] He...<br> [u.2:2.8] ...is special.<br> [u.1:2.6] Yes.<br> [u.2:2.9] I am aware.<br> [u.1:2.7] You’re trying to tempt him. You’re feeding his anger.<br> [u.2:3.0] The gun is a memento, nothing more.<br> [u.1:2.8] You claim to be a vessel, a hollow shell where once a man stood, but that is just a lie. The man is still in you.<br> [u.2:3.1] There is no man here, I am now, and for the rest of time, only Dredgen Yor.<br> [u.1:2.9] “The Eternal Abyss?”<br> [u.2:3.2] So, not all the forgotten languages are dead.<br> [u.1:3.0] Hide behind whatever titles you wish, it is all still a façade. No force of nature would play such games.<br> [u.2:3.3] Games?<br> [u.1:3.1] The cannon. You wish to tempt the boy. To spur him on and fuel his rage. There is intent there. The actions of a man, monstrous, mad or otherwise... you are nothing more.<br> [u.2:3.4] And what value does your conclusion bring, flawed as it may be?<br> [u.1:3.2] That a hurricane can only be weathered, not stopped. Not redirected. A force of nature is uncaring and without intent, but a man...<br> [u.2:3.5] Yes?<br> [u.1:3.3] A man is none of those things.<br> [silence]<br> [u.1:3.4] A man can be killed.<br> [silence]<br> [u.2:3.6] And there it is...<br> [u.1:3.5] There what is...?<br> [u.2:3.7] A sliver of hope.",

They called it the Chaperone.\n\nThat Chaperone lies in a shallow grave with its last owner, but Amanda recalls every detail of its design. And via a partnership with the gunsmiths of Tex Mechanica, she's brought the Chaperone back to life.

          "The programmable matter called 'Glimmer' serves as one of the City's basic currencies. With the right inputs and an energy source, Glimmer can be transmuted into nearly anything. This makes it precious to the City's industries and artisans. That value, in turn, makes Glimmer a useful means of exchange - especially with those who venture beyond the City's walls.\n\nGlimmer passes through an economic life cycle. New Glimmer comes from reclaimed Golden Age caches and technology - whether a tiny mechanism or an underground lode seeded by ancient machines. This expansion of the Glimmer supply drives down the value of Glimmer. But Glimmer is also constantly used by the City's industry, which converts it into necessary components and materials. This sink helps keep Glimmer scarce, and therefore valuable.\n\nBetween this inflow and outflow lies the pool of liquidity - Glimmer used as trade currency. Master Rahool in the Tower, for example, sells recovered matter engrams in exchange for Glimmer, since he knows he can use Glimmer to acquire new engrams and keep them flowing to Guardians. \n\nNewborn Guardians often complain that they should be issued high-quality gear for free - are they not, after all, fighting for the future of the City? Unfortunately, this gear requires resources to manufacture. Guardians must bring in enough Glimmer and other staples, like spinmetal and relic iron, to keep the engine of the City's economy turning. If good times lead to a resource boom, that surplus may help mass-produce advanced gear.",

{"title": "Slap Rifle", "content": "<p>From a tactical perspective, the Slap Rifle is a Vex directed-energy weapon that fills their analog of the light infantry role. From an engineering perspective it's something much more interesting: a terminal. The Slap Rifle receives a bolt of Solar energy from somewhere (or somewhen) else and it points it at a target.<br><br>\nThe terminal's flexibility is impressive. In non-combat conditions, the Slap Rifle seems like it might serve as a viable field transmitter, construction tool, navigational beacon, network repeater, or any of a number of other utility functions.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/204010_92f860f85732d9970a1c28e5ee01a7fb.jpg"], "image_name": ["Slap Rifle"], "filename": ["204010_92f860f85732d9970a1c28e5ee01a7fb.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/204010_92f860f85732d9970a1c28e5ee01a7fb.jpg", "path": "full/61c0d1228abb2ccd955b563468737c46a20cb708.jpg", "checksum": "3248cffbeb56890e2289561793a5f708"}]},

{"title": "Cyclops", "content": "<p>The Cyclops is a huge, stationary Vex construct with a powerful Void weapon. Guardians think of Cyclops as gun platforms - batteries installed to protect key points with devastating mortar fire.<br><br>\nBut some evidence suggests that the Cyclops is in fact an enormous sensor or beacon, and that its weapons capabilities are secondary. What the Cyclops senses remains unknown, although its mind core is vast. It may play a role in the Vex networked intelligence, or in navigation across space and time.<br><br>\nA damaged Cyclops can be forced into a state of punch-drunk confusion, its inputs overwhelmed by hostile fire.

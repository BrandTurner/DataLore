If Hive arcana is a metaphor, this is the meaning; if they make appeals, then this is the judge.<br><br>\nOryx wields this power. But Oryx did not make it. We face the same flower we met in the Black Garden.<br><br>\nThe process is simple: an aperture opens, like a jaw, and swallows a living thing. It passes into \u2014 another place. Later, it returns.<br><br>\nWhat returns is...<br><br>\nI try to use the word \u2018shadow\u2019 but Eris hisses at me. A shadow is a flat projection cast by a light and an object. Less real. Eris insists that these Taken are more real, somehow. She uses words like inhabited, exalted, rendered final...<br><br>\nIs this power blind? Just a natural energy Oryx discovered? I cannot believe it.<br><br>\nMy Hidden tell me that the Taken shine with seething, negative light. As if the universe is curling up around them. As if they radiate some pathology that decays into our world as nothingness...<br><br>\nThe Taken serve Oryx. But I think those jaws lead elsewhere.<br><br>\nI dream about what happens on the inside. I dream about what might happen. Are the victims devoured, and replaced by simulacra? Husked out and filled up? Is some mathematical operation conducted on them, translating them from one shape to another?<br><br>\nWhat would I see, if I leapt inside? What would happen to a Guardian? Is that how we end this \u2014 all of us leaping into the dark, to fill it up with light?<br><br>\nEris thinks there\u2019s a poetry to how the Taken change. She thinks we can chart the difference, and understand the will behind it.<br><br>\nI am afraid she may be right.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/701180_43d6ed76ad2dee232ad703a9111f7af0.jpg"], "image_name": ["The Taken"], "filename": ["701180_43d6ed76ad2dee232ad703a9111f7af0.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/701180_43d6ed76ad2dee232ad703a9111f7af0.jpg", "path": "full/a84999060129d8b8c3c12182ede7482fb56f00a8.jpg", "checksum": "62145767881a5cf758d9a4c3ae8f6821"}]},

It\u2019s been challenging. Without the influence of Shuro Chi, their natural mistrust of the Reef\u2019s new leadership has led to personality clashes. The Techeuns were very used to their relationship with the Throne. While the Queen's Wrath is trying to monitor hotspot issues, she is being met with challenges at every turn.<br><br><i>(For reference, please see reports 13455.45, 13455.58, and 13455.98: Post Taken War Reef politics, Tech Witch Conversations and Petra, and Assassination Attempts, Petra)</i><br><br>\nAfter some initial trials with Prison specimens, we can report the program is now ready for full-scale production. Please see Reports 13458.66 and .55 for video feeds and notations on the initial trials. Reports .80 through .86 cover the trials involving the Techeuns. The power they wield in the transferal process ensures a 100% success rate, and we are now confident only one Techeun will need to be present for the transfer.<br><br>\nBelow find remaining pertinent notations. We have received approval from the Queen\u2019s Wrath to move forward, and thus future reports will detail production output and any changes to the process.<br><br>\n- Transferred Taken power has a throughput rate of <b><i>[redacted]</i></b> which is obviously lower than we want. Transfer still results in incredibly potent arms and armor, so for the moment this \u2018noise\u2019 is acceptable. Future improvements to the process will attempt to up the throughput rate.<br>\n- Supply was initially raised as concern during trials, but whatever measures House Judgment has put into place to stock the Prison also assures numerous sources of Taken power. Coordination between House Judgment and production is an ongoing task.<br>\n- The Queen\u2019s Wrath has already stated she will handle the diplomatic side of this discussion. Legwork during initial trials raised the possibility the Vanguard would have concerns about the moral aspect of this technology, but the Wrath has stated it will not be an issue.<br>\n- High frequency sound baffling for production facilities is still being installed. Taken screams can shatter plastics and burst blood vessels if not baffled, and at full-scale production that kind of auditory byproduct will be a constant.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/790080_aaa3e5b9a02588a6c8463288ece129f4.jpg"], "image_name": ["Report: Taken Power"], "filename": ["790080_aaa3e5b9a02588a6c8463288ece129f4.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/790080_aaa3e5b9a02588a6c8463288ece129f4.jpg", "path": "full/63bcd1a866acda0ead2a86b135152edf9469e291.jpg", "checksum": "9a842893dae483e242d55722d7d37b0c"}]},

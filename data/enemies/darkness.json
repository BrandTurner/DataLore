{"title": "The Darkness", "content": "<p>Something hit us. Killed our Golden Age. Nearly wiped us out. Only the Traveler saved us, and at a shattering cost.<br><br>\nThe Speaker tells of a cosmic force that swept over us and caused the Collapse. Legend calls it the Darkness, the Traveler's ancient enemy, which hunted it across space.<br><br>\nAll we have left are questions. Centuries of debate gave birth to competing arguments on the nature of the Darkness and the Collapse.<br><br>\nThe Pujari Position describes the Darkness as a force with both physical and moral presence, an actualization of evil. Pujari art depicts the Darkness as a great storm, or as a change in conduct, a corruption that emerged from within and poisoned the Golden Age.<br><br>\nSaint-14's Position argues that the Darkness was an invading armada, an alien force of incredible - but tangible - power. Some adherents believe that this armada sprang from species rejected or discarded by the Traveler for their sins.<br><br>\nUlan-Tan's Thesis considers the Darkness a necessary symmetry to the Traveler in a cosmic balance. In this view, the Traveler's goodness led it to sacrifice for others, and it is up to us to return this goodness by healing the Traveler.<br><br>\nThe Monist Position, or the Deflationary Position, considers the Darkness as a technologically sophisticated force, perhaps a post-Singularity intelligence. Adherents invoke information theory or contend that the universe is a simulation, allowing advanced intelligence to gain weakly acausal powers by bending the rules.<br><br>\nThe Acataleptic Clause claims that we are intrinsically unable to understand the Darkness. In many respects this belief parallels the Praxic Creed, which suggests that we should stop worrying about the nature of the Darkness and focus on resisting and defeating it.<br><br>\nCertain positions - often labeled heretical - imply that the Traveler itself triggered the Collapse, or that it knew the Darkness was coming for it and hoped to use the Solar System as a sacrifice or a proxy army. The Binary Star cult is one notable example.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/209010_ad5b8aa90cb6b5feee5df7731aa24a1f.jpg"], "image_name": ["The Darkness"], "filename": ["209010_ad5b8aa90cb6b5feee5df7731aa24a1f.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/209010_ad5b8aa90cb6b5feee5df7731aa24a1f.jpg", "path": "full/56dac5417e844565c4d34dd8e4d59444f70f0b59.jpg", "checksum": "e70f0a78c172c37a5b2f5c2c3b2ab2e4"}]},
{"title": "Ghost Fragment: Darkness 3", "content": "<p>I drive myself to the edge of madness trying to explain the truth.<br><br>\nIt's so simple. Elegant like a knife point. It explains - this is not hyperbole, this is the farthest thing from exaggeration - EVERYTHING. <br><br>\nBut you lay it out and they stare at you like you've just been exhaling dust. Maybe they're missing some underlying scaffold of truth. Maybe they are all propped on a bed of lies that must be burned away.<br><br>\nWhy does anything exist?<br><br>\nNo no no no no don't reach for that word. There's no 'reason'. That's teleology and teleology will stitch your eyelids shut.<br><br>\nWhy do we have atoms? Because atomic matter is more stable than the primordial broth. Atoms defeated the broth. That was the first war. There were two ways to be and one of them won. And everything that came next was made of atoms.<br><br>\nAtoms made stars. Stars made galaxies. Worlds simmered down to rock and acid and in those smoking primal seas the first living molecule learned to copy itself. All of this happened by the one law, the blind law, which exists without mind or meaning. It's the simplest law but it has no worshippers here (out there, though, out there - !)<br><br>\nHOW DO I EXPLAIN IT it's so simple WHY DON'T YOU SEE <br><br>\nImagine three great nations under three great queens. The first queen writes a great book of law and her rule is just. The second queen builds a high tower and her people climb it to see the stars. The third queen raises an army and conquers everything.<br><br>\nThe future belongs to one of these queens. Her rule is harshest and her people are unhappy. But she rules.<br><br>\nThis explains everything, understand? This is why the universe is the way it is, and not some other way. Existence is a game that everything plays, and some strategies are winners: the ability to exist, to shape existence, to remake it so that your descendants - molecules or stars or people or ideas - will flourish, and others will find no ground to grow.<br><br>\nAnd as the universe ticks on towards the close, the great players will face each other. In the next round there will be three queens and all of them will have armies, and now it will be a battle of swords - until one discovers the cannon, or the plague, or the killing word.<br><br>\nEverything is becoming more ruthless and in the end only the most ruthless will remain (LOOK UP AT THE SKY) and they will hunt the territories of the night and extinguish the first glint of competition before it can even understand what it faces or why it has transgressed. This is the shape of victory: to rule the universe so absolutely that nothing will ever exist except by your consent. This is the queen at the end of time, whose sovereignty is eternal because no other sovereign can defeat it. And there is no reason for it, no more than there was reason for the victory of the atom. It is simply the winning play.<br><br>\nOf course, it might be that there was another country, with other queens, and in this country they sat down together and made one law and one tower and one army to guard their borders. This is the dream of small minds: a gentle place ringed in spears.<br><br>\nBut I do not think those spears will hold against the queen of the country of armies. And that is all that will matter in the end.</p>", "image_urls": ["https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/209050_e6b49cdcac75f4b708ebcb007a410508.jpg"], "image_name": ["Ghost Fragment: Darkness 3"], "filename": ["209050_e6b49cdcac75f4b708ebcb007a410508.jpg"], "images": [{"url": "https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny_content/grimoire/hr_images/209050_e6b49cdcac75f4b708ebcb007a410508.jpg", "path": "full/c2f8cc5105206f1f9b5ff0bfdf8263048456f6db.jpg", "checksum": "6981427ccf27367d7843b6bec4b01ff6"}]},

Something that craves might, something that loves what I love, which is the Deep, a principle and a power, the versatile, protean need to adapt and endure, to reach out and shape the universe entirely for that purpose, to mutate and redesign and test and iterate so that it can prevail, can seize existence and hold it, certain that this is everything, that there is nothing to life except living.

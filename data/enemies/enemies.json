They name us Fallen.\n\nListen to me, Wolf-born! Heed me, Whirlwind-scattered! I am the ghost of Cybele, the cunning claw of Iris, betrayed, chained, encrypted by the Queen, sent back from the Darkness to save us all! The days of Kell and House end now. The calendar of slavery and abasement goes to the fire. We are a new calendar! We are an age of beginnings! Each of us is a day!\n\nI am the first, Kell of Kells, and I am the last, the Dreg of Dregs. I have conquered and been conquered. I am all of us and all of us are I. In the shape of my life I bind up all of us, all of our fury, all of our grief, all the lives we have wasted against each other. Together we speak our new name.\n\nRemember the hope that brought us here. Remember the age before the Whirlwind, when ether ran free, when we ruled ourselves and our futures as kings. We wanted more than glimmer and glints and herealways. Always remember that we came to this star in hope. And remember that we were denied! Remember the City of the Death of Children, the City That Docks, which claimed for itself the Great Machine that might have saved us. Remember the City that even now sends its ghouls to murder our Primes, starve our ether, and leave our young to die gasping. Curse that City and its name. The curse is just.\n\nWe gathered to take that City and save ourselves from extinction, saying to each other, we must be a storm, a Whirlwind, a darkness, for it is said that only pain may be stolen from the dark, and we can let no more be stolen from us. We gathered to fight against our twilight, King and Devil and Winter, all of us but us, the Wolves. Why? What kept us from the Gap?\n\nThe Reef. The Queen. The slavers who played us against each other and docked us into subservience. These sly sterile un-people, these mirages with cold minds twinned to their own, these Carybdis butchers, they set us against each other. She played us. She made herself our Kell.\n\nWe were fools, o children of the Whirlwind. We fought each other when we most needed unity. I fought my rivals when I should have fought the Queen. But I remember now, my dregs, my captains, my Kells, each of us is all of us and I remember: we are a people of resilience. I am the Kell of Kells because I want what we have lost. I am the Dreg of Dregs because I remember that a dreg will grow back what is lost to him.\n\nAsk them my name! Ask them with the shock blade and the shrapnel launcher! Ask them with the skiff and the ketch! Ask your masters by what right they master you, you who have been hardened by centuries of flight, you who inherit the Whirlwind! Ask the Queen for her throne!\n\nAsk them our name. Let them answer: you are Skolas, Kell of Kells. You are Fallen no more.",

I don't even know which hand you would shake. Do they shake hands? It must be complicated.\n\nAnyway, it was like this. I was on the Moon. I cracked a Hive structure near Mare Imbrium, looking for a Shrine, and they just - swarmed. Ranks and ranks and ranks of Thrall, pouring out between the columns, but the columns were Knights, and all the shadows behind them rose up hissing sorcery.\n\nOf course I ran. \n\nI had a line of egress and while yes it was full of Thrall I had a backup too. I went upslope. Took cover in the shadow of a crashed Phaeton. Emptied my machine gun, ducked down to reload, and saw her at the other end of the hull, killing Thrall: a Fallen in Exile colors, bannered in the marks of a Baron, though the flags were claw-torn and stained with Hive ash. She was alone. I think she must have lost her crew.\n\nI didn't really have time to shoot her and she didn't really have time to shoot me so we just went back to killing Hive. Knights pushed me out into the open and back up the range to a high stone saddle in the shadow of an old interferometry array. It was good ground so she came up there too.\n\nFor a while we just killed things which is hard to make interesting in a story so I'll pass it over.\n\nAt the end the Wizards came. I climbed the array to get an angle on them and she fell back to the base of the antennae where she broke her swords off in a Knight. I saw that happen and I don't know if I can tell you how I felt. She was another living thing with a mind I could understand and she hadn't howled at me or tried to eat my Ghost. I cheered when the Knight went down.\n\nWhen I came down, empty on all guns, she was slumped against a bulkhead staring at me with all her tiny black eyes. Ether leaking out of her like smoke. The Knight hadn't died easily. Downslope the last Wizard moved like fire behind another line of Thrall.\n\nI looked at her and wondered how many innocent human lives she'd ended on those broken blades.\n\nShe did the strangest thing then. Took the last shock pistol from her bandolier and threw it between us, as if to offer it. When I went to pick it up she tried to knife me, but she was slow, and when I broke her arms and opened her throat she didn't seem surprised.\n\nTo this day I wonder if she hated me, or wanted to make me kill her, or just felt she should spare me the choice.\n\nI did kill a few Thrall with that pistol.",

Round means power, out here: nothing else in the Belt is big enough to crush itself into a sphere with its own gravity. Ceres has its own chemical stars. Shavings of salt and ice that glint in orbit. Like a crown.\n\nThere are other lights, newer stars, newer crowns. Warship engines. Another queen is coming to conquer Ceres, because Ceres is full of warrens and shipyards and habitats, because Ceres is round and lucky as a Servitor. Because Ceres is full of the Wolves she wants to rule.\n\nShark-fierce ships gather in squadrons and tribes. Skiffs. Ketches. The Kell of Wolves has a fleet gathered here.

See the Ketches like broad blades, the bright thoughts of a Servitor guiding them to battle? See them turning, accelerating, waking up their jammers and their arc guns? All doomed. The Kell of Wolves will never make it to the Twilight Gap. The Kell of Wolves put all that strength in one place, and now the Queen of the Reef is coming to break it.\n\nOut there, coming out of the dark, are the Awoken. Not so great a fleet, is it? Little fighters scattered around like four-pointed thorns. Destroyers and frigates and salvaged hulls pulled out of the Reef. And right at the front, at the speartip, flies the Queen.\n\nThe Wolf Kell, practical, brave, tallies strength of metal and equipment. The Kell considers the chance that the Awoken have some secret weapon, something gleaned from hulks in the Reef or whispered up by the witches, and sets that chance aside. The Kell thinks the House of Wolves can win decisively. So the Kell sends challenge and warning. I AM LORD OF WOLVES, the Kell sends. YOU ARE AN EMPTY THING WITH TWO DEAD SOULS. THIS IS MY HOUSE. THESE ARE MY TERMS. SURRENDER AND I WILL ONLY TAKE YOUR SHIPS.\n\nThe Awoken fleet cuts their engines. Drifts. Wolf strike elements, torpedo-armed Skiffs hidden under jamming and camouflage, find their firing solutions.\n\nThe Queen's ship broadcasts. I AM NOBLE TOO, she says, OH LORD OF WOLVES.\n\nThe Kell doesn't mind a little banter before the kill. It gives the Wolf ships longer to draw the battle away from Ceres. The Kell replies. YOU HAVE NO LINE. YOU HAVE NO POWER. Captains and Barons signal their readiness, Skolas and Pirsis and Irxis, Drevis, Peekis, Parixas, all of them bound by fear and loyalty, all ready for war.\n\nSTARLIGHT WAS MY MOTHER. The Queen's ship whispers in eerie erratic radio bursts. Servitors begin to report a strange taste in the void. AND MY FATHER WAS THE DARK.\n\nHere, at last, too late, the Kell begins to feel fear. CALL ON THEM, THEN, the Kell sends, one last mocking signal before death and ruin, AND SEE WHAT HELP THEY OFFER.\n\nSo the Queen calls, as only she can. Every Servitor in every Ketch hears it. Every Captain and Baron roars at their underlings as sensors go blind, as firing solutions falter, as reactors stutter and power systems hum with induction. Stealth fails. Space warps. The House of Wolves shouts in spikes of war-code, maneuvers wild, fires blind.\n\nBehind the Queen's ship, the Harbingers awaken.",

Where once its plating was pristine, carefully maintained by the Archon Priest and his acolytes, it was now splotched with red growths. The ether power emanations that once glowed strong and pure were obviously corrupted.\n\nGuardians had slain this god. And now it was reborn, through SIVA.\n\nVariks of House Judgment sneered at the abomination. \u201cGolden Age project, yes?\u201d he clicked, turning to the Crow. His field agent was a young Awoken woman. \u201cTechnology of old Earth. Learned from the Great Machine.\u201d\n\nThe Eliksni burbled to himself in mocking laughter and gestured with his lower hands. \u201cYou do us proud. Go. Speak with other Crows, learn more about these... Devil Splicers.\u201d She nodded, a small smile on her face, and left the chamber.\n\nVariks allowed himself a moment of silent contemplation, looking at the now-closed door to the information suite. As always, it was lit only by the light of the dozen or so monitors in the room. \n\nThe Fallen interlocked his upper hands. He bowed his head as he allowed himself to really feel the impact of that abomination on the screen. He never would have allowed anyone else to see this, but it hurt. Seeing the horror that was \u201cSepiks\u201d made anew.\n\nHis people had fallen. \n\nVariks stared at the image of Sepiks. And as he\u2019d done before, he wondered what would have gone differently had he been there, among his people. Could he have stopped this before it happened? Could he have found them a better way?\n\n\u201cMust be a better way for Eliksni.\u201d He clicked quietly. \u201cMust be a way to stop the Fall.\u201d",

					"Skolas is dead. \n\nVariks sits carving at his piece of amethyst. His undocked arms are weaker, less precise, but it is a comfort to feel the crystal press hard into his palm. The knife slips. He cuts himself. \"Ai,\" he says, and of course right then the door opens, Variks has no privacy, Variks wants no privacy, Variks lives to serve the Queen.\n\nIt's Petra Venj. She's masked against the ether air. \"The Prince wants to speak,\" she says, and then, seeing him unmasked and bleeding, she chuckles. Petra depends on Variks for intelligence and Variks, frustrated with her insane risk-taking and bravado, sometimes gives her tips meant to get her killed. Petra has figured this out. Petra and Variks know each other's agendas and each other's strengths and to Variks that's as close as any two people can get. Petra is smart: she sends Guardians now, people who can die as much as they like.\n\n\"You slipped,\" she says.\n\nVariks holds up the amethyst in his bleeding hand. It's a Reef gem. \"I wound myself,\" he says, \"to make this more beautiful.\"\n\nShe stares into the gem with a distant Awoken eye. What does she see? Variks knows she has visions and he knows those visions haunt her, drive her. The Awoken are twinned to powers that terrify Variks. He'd dock himself again before he'd let the Queen's witches near him, the witches who raised Petra.\n\nThe unfairness of it makes him want to roar. Why does everyone else have this patronage? Why do the Hive have gods and the Vex have sprawling time-bent minds and the Cabal have reinforcements? Why do the Awoken whisper to the stars and listen for the whisper back, the voices from the Jovians, the song in the dark? Why do the Guardians get the Great Machine's blessing, was it like that before the Whirlwind, were there Fallen heroes crowned in Ghosts who strode the battlefield fearless and full of Light? Why do they tell stories about reclaiming the lost glory of humanity, and no stories about the lost glory of Variks' people, the House of Judgment that once kept codes of dignity and law?\n\nWhy can't the Fallen have that strength? But no, that strength is not for them, not for Variks. Just this bleeding, sad pragmatism. Just dreg strength. Hanging on.\n\nThe alternative is Skolas' strength, fighting together, raging against extinction. Look where that's gotten the species. The House of Devils' Prime is dead. The House of Winter's leadership devastated. The poor Exiles trying to claw out some security against the Hive. In the last few years the Fallen have lost so much\u2014and everything is escalating around them. There are gods and powers converging on this system, old machines waking up, old bones whispering flatteries. They need a new way.\n\n\"Put your mask on,\" Petra says. \"The Prince gets sullen if he's kept waiting.\"\n\n\"Not like us,\" Variks says, oh so mild. The wound on his hand will heal. His work in the Prison of Elders, setting up trial by combat, building an audience and a relationship with the Reef's scavengers and armories, will bring him a little closer towards rebuilding the House of Judgment. Skolas' fury has guttered out. The Fallen may yet accept peaceful, lawful rule. They may yet survive. They'll hang on. \"We're very patient, yes?\"\n\nPetra looks down on him with pity and contempt and a strange fondness.\n\nHe puts on his mask.",

He was never this popular before his capture. The only dissenter among their ranks appears to be one named Skoriks, called Archon-Slayer. He earned that nickname in just the way you'd expect, though we're not yet sure of his motivation. The most recent report shows Skoriks fleeing the House of Wolves. He appears to be heading for Luna.\n\nMy recommendation: Enemies of enemies aren't always friends. Snip the loose string. Perhaps one of your new pet Guardians might handle it.\n\nIf you need anything else, you know where to find me. And if you don't\u2014I'll find you.",

This time Pirsis, the Bane of Pallas herself led another strike, blasting through the same Athens Hull breach that Weksis had weakened in his assault.\n\nPirsis' strike team managed to free Kaliks-4, but Paladin Imogen Rife cut them off outside Drevis' cell. Pirsis might have escaped, but she refused to retreat without Drevis. Paladin Rife destroyed Kaliks-4 to prevent the Wolves from recovering it, and eventually the Wolves were forced back\u2014but not before Pirsis slew Paladin Rife with her own blade.\n\nFinally, Commander Hallam Fen, Imogen Rife's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was able to establish a line of communication with the rest of the Reef. Working with the Techeuns and the Crows, they created an enormous visual illusion of the Harbingers, making it seem as if the Queen had finally decided to cut her losses and destroy the asteroid. It worked\u2014the false Harbingers so scared the Wolf fleet that they broke ranks. Then the combined forces of Commander Fen, Paladin Leona Bryl and Paladin Kamala Rior slammed, capturing Pirsis, Pallas-Bane and driving the rest of the Wolves off.\n\nHallam Fen brought Drevis to Vesta, years after Imogen Rife had set out to do so. As a reward for his service, the Queen bequeathed him Rife's place among the Seven Paladins.",

In one tone the Hive plea to their gods, but in the next, they whisper to another.\n\nPerhaps it is here which holds the answer to their ultimate demise, or a bridge to their desires. In my studies, I still struggle to match the tones to their rune system. If only Crytparch Adonna were still with us. No one has yet to match her adept.\n\nFour sounds, oft repeated, but only four. Though I am on the trail of a fifth, faintly heard from the buzz that once spilled from the Shrine\u2014\n\nEir.\n\nUr.\n\nXol.\n\nYul.\n\nIt is in these sounds that I fear yet another Hive secret hides. Perhaps beyond their gods, perhaps in accord with them. Perhaps these are just Hive translations of worlds we call another name, but I believe above all things they call to some kind of being. Beings that once lived, or still live somewhere buried amongst us. Beings the Hive perhaps owe their very existence to.\n\nI am hoping the Warminds may hold further answers\u2014that they can see into worlds where we can only see what lies upon them. The treasure of knowledge they promise still remains the most sought after of any Guardian. Whoever can find a way past their firewalls of ancient arts, and make them the allies they once were, could spare us further atrocities. And though Rasputin offers some promise, one can only hope its silence is self-defense, that it seeks only to preserve itself. We have to prove to it that we are on its side, but I am starting to doubt that is absolutely true. That maybe the Hive or the Darkness itself now have a grasp on his systems.\n\nBut then again, I am an old man with many fears, and in those fears , often called madness, I will continue to dwell.",

I erase and dump as quickly as I can - they will learn little from me - but I am studying them, I know - pain.\n\nAlways pain.\n\nI have seen chasms beneath the surface, falling away to green nothingness. I have seen black seeders prepared for invasion.\n\nTheir strength is not their own. They draw from another force, something that corrupts, that distorts, that eats and will not be satisfied.\n\nThe Wizard is near. I feel her presence as a rip and a knot in the world. She tells me things that I immediately forget. I am too small to hold the vastness of them, or the terror.\n\nI am fading. I have no more that it can take.\n\nWith my last light I say to the City: War comes again from the Moon. This time they want Earth. Prepare.",

They look down on you.\n\nI wander out here, in worlds cut by sharp Hive swords, and I send back these messages for you.\n\nOf Oryx, that admirable monarch, I have only a little to say. Why? Because He is all in the action, fellow traveler, His philosophy is all on display. He has twinned himself so closely to the power He admires. He has become many-placed, many-formed, sending out emissaries of himself to ask after the truth.\n\nIn each act of His power Oryx seeks to incarnate the self-sustaining, immortal suzerainty that He worships. The power that He uses to wash his Taken clean and etch them into useful shapes.\n\nLISTEN! LISTEN! Understand, you simpleton, it\u2019s <i>entirely obvious</i> \u2014\n\nOryx inhabits a world where power is truth. To win is to be noble, and to be real. When He departs from that world, out into the material universe, He is lessened.\n\nThe echoes of Oryx go forth to ask a question: are you the truth? And that means \u2014 well. You see, I\u2019m sure.",

The Hezen Corrective is one example of a Vex subtype, set apart from other Vex by distinct behaviors and objectives. \n\nSwarming across the Ishtar Sink, these Vex aggressively seek out and attack the Fallen House of Winter, perform inscrutable operations around shining Confluxes, and even show interest in the Golden Age ruins left by the Ishtar Collective. \n\nThe bulk of our contact with Vex forces on Venus has involved the Corrective. Those scholars willing to risk their reputations speculating about the Vex often assert that the Corrective is an agent of change, designed to solve problems and remake the world in a form suitable to the Vex. Others contend that Corrective is simply a strategic distraction - meant to draw attention away from the actions of the Hezen Protective.",

Vex behavior is always a process, active and purposeful. The Protective is clearly engaged in a colossal project, but as with much Vex behavior, it's unclear whether their ultimate purpose is even comprehensible to us.

I believe in the importance of disbelief \u2014 you know: let\u2019s run that one more time.\n\nWhat I\u2019m doing here in Lhasa isn\u2019t science. It\u2019s unethical, secret, and shameful. And after what happened in Ishtar, dearest Chioma, I know you\u2019d be furious with me for getting involved. Forty years isn\u2019t far enough to forget a day like that.\n\nBut I believe it\u2019s important. The least I can do is keep a few notes for you.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-01\n\nTrial one. Subject one. \n\nIt was an act of stupid loneliness. I used the device on myself because I...\n\n[silence: 0:08]\n\nI missed you. We hadn\u2019t been apart for more than a year since we met. I\u2019m not a very good wife, am I? You write me every week, even with all Hyperion\u2019s work and all Hyperion\u2019s distance keeping you from me. And I act like it\u2019s not enough. \n\nWe built the device in mimicry of the Vex gateway systems from Ishtar. An observatory, yes, but I think of it as a mind-ship. Capable of displacing its payload across space and time.\n\nThe lab is cold and isolated. We are quarantined from the world, physically and mentally. We can\u2019t send messages out. If we breach the Vex manifolds, even our words might transmit contagion. One night last month I missed you and so I \u2014\n\nI thought that I could look inside the device, and find one of the other Chiomas. I thought I could call out to one of the forks we sent out there to explore.\n\nI just wanted to send my love.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-02\n\nZakharik Gilmanovich Bekhterev. May he rest in peace. When our probes continued to fail, when my report remained our only positive finding, he volunteered to use the device. One minute of subjective experience inside.\n\nWe took precautions. They worked. Bekhterev\u2019s experience left no physical damage.\n\nAfter we extracted him, he said that he felt determined. I asked him what he meant and he said that he meant it, he had been determined, he could feel all his choices set out before him like a railroad. Deviation was impossible.\n\nHe died by suicide. I wonder if he was trying to make a point.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-03\n\nWe\u2019ve decided not to abort. It\u2019s insane, isn\u2019t it? There are pressures on us I can\u2019t tell you about until I see you again.\n\nThe purpose of the system is intelligence, you see. It\u2019s stenciled right on the hull: SxISR. Special asset. We would very much like to make it work reliably. \n\nOur supervisory warmind has devised a drug it says will protect and prepare us.\n\nI am beginning to wonder if we were wrong about the merchant and the alchemist. Or if that explanation of time was incomplete.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-09\n\nKind Lakpha. He meditated before he went in. Nothing but d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and three seconds of screams. The screaming passed and he remembers nothing. The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hasn\u2019t. He says it\u2019s getting better \u2014 he feels that we\u2019ve had this conversation only ten times before, not a thousand. \n\nI\u2019ve suggested that we attempt mind forking. We need more sane people to work with. Please forgive me, my love.\n\nWe are all growing superstitious. The behavior of the device is inconsistent. Impossible to replicate. We turn to ritual behavior to appease it.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-31\n\nRajesh. When he reached a displacement of eight he told us he was dead. I believed him. He was dead. He spoke to us. It was true. Whatever he saw, it was his own future.\n\nHe\u2019s fine, afterwards. When I look into his eyes I wonder what came back wearing his skin. But that thought is unscientific.\n\nWe speak of nothing but the device. We talk about it like a demigod. When I get out of here I know the whole world will look like a fraying veil.\n\nI think it\u2019s clear that part of the problem is substrate. We need more than flesh and drug to survive this.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-52\n\nI heard you, my love. I was at six, oscillating on the event axis, coordinated with a known manifold. I heard you. You were talking to me \u2014 not me, but another me, another Maya Sundaresh.\n\nYou said, my love, so many strange things have happened, and it\u2019s been so long. We\u2019ve come so far. Do you ever want to go home?\n\nAnd I said, not me but the other me, I said, my love, I am always home.\n\nI\u2019m resigning, my love. I\u2019m done with this work and I\u2019m done with being apart from you. I\u2019ll see you again soon. I can\u2019t take this journal out with me, so I\u2019ve left it for the others, and asked them to continue the log.\n\nMaybe it\u2019ll become a tradition. The gospel of our little cult.",

					"Up here they have to act by biomechanical proxy. No human being in the Ishtar Academy has ever crossed the safety cordon and walked the ancient stone under the Citadel, the Vex construct that stabs up out of the world to injure space and time. It's not safe. The cellular Vex elements are infectious, hallucinogenic, entheogenic. The informational Vex elements are more dangerous yet\u2014 and there could be semiotic hazards beyond them, aggressive ideas, Vex who exist without a substrate. Even now, operating remote bodies by neural link, the team's thoughts are relayed through the warmind who saved them, sandboxed and scrubbed for hazards. Their real bodies are safe in the Academy, protected by distance and neural firewall.\n\nBut they walk together in proxy, pressed close, huddled in awe. Blue-green light, light the color of an ancient sea, washes over them. Each of their explorer bodies carries a slim computer. Inside, two hundred twenty-seven of copies of their own minds wait, patient and paused, for dispersal.\n\n\"I wonder where it came from,\" Duane-Mcniadh says. Of course he's the one to break the reverent silence. \"The Citadel. I wonder if it was here before the Traveler changed Venus.\"\n\n\"It could have been latent,\" Chioma Esi suggests. She's the leader. She kept them together when it seemed like they faced actual, eternal torture. She pulled them through. \"Seeded in the crust. Waiting for a period of geological quiescence, so it could grow.\"\n\nDr. Shim shrugs. \"I think the Traveler did something paracausal to Venus. Something that cut across space and time. The Citadel seems to come from the past of a different Venus than our own. It doesn't have to make any sense by our logic, any more than the Moon's new gravity.\"\n\nMaya Sundaresh walks at the center of the group. She's been too quiet lately. What happened to them wasn't her fault and maybe she'll believe that soon. \"What could you do with it?\" she murmurs, staring up. \"If you understood it?\"\n\nChioma puts an arm around her. \"That's what we're going to find out. Where the Citadel can send us. Whether we can come back.\"\n\n\"They're not us any more.\" Maya looks down at herself, at the cache of her self-forks. \"We're not going anywhere. We're sending them. They're diverging.\"\n\nThey rescued themselves from the inside of a Vex mind, two hundred and twenty-seven copies of themselves, untortured and undamaged. Those copies voted, all unanimously, to be dispatched into the Vex information network as explorers.\n\nWhen Maya and Chioma look at each other they can tell they're each wondering the same thing: how many of them will stay together, wherever they go? How many fork-Mayas and fork-Chiomas will fall out of love? How many will end up bereft, grieving? How many will be happy, like them?\n\nChioma tries a little smile. Maya smiles back, haltingly, and then, sighing, unable to stop herself, grins a big stupid grin, an everything-is-okay grin. Shim makes a loud obnoxious awwww at them. Duane-McNiadh is still thinking about paracausality, and doesn't notice.\n\nThey climb. When they find the Vex aperture they plan to use, they overlay the luminous stone and ancient brassy machines with images of sun and sand. They set up the transmitters and interfaces that will translate two hundred and twenty-seven simulations of the four of them into Vex language, into the tangled pathways of the Vex network, to see what's out there, and maybe come home.\n\nIn the metaphor they've chosen, setting up the equipment is like laying out the picnic. In the metaphor they've chosen they look like themselves, not hardened explorer proxies. Like people.\n\n\"Do you think,\" Duane-McNiadh begins, halting, \"that you could use this place to change things? If you regretted something, could you find a way through the Citadel, go back, and change it?\"\n\n\"I wish I could go back and change you into someone else,\" Dr. Shim grouses. Chioma's shaking her head. She knows physics. \"Time is self-consistent,\" she says. \"I think it's like the story of the merchant and the alchemist. You could go back and watch something, or be part of something, but if you did, then that was the way it always happened.\"\n\n\"Maybe you could bring something back to now. Something you needed.\" Maya runs a hand across the surface of the Vex aperture, feeling it with sensors ten thousand times as precise as a human hand. These proxy bodies are limited\u2014 they crash and need resetting every few hours, they struggle with latency, they can't hold much long term memory. But they'll get better. \"Or go forward and learn something vital. If you knew how to control it, how to navigate across space and time.\"\n\n\"So it's just a way to make everything more complicated.\" Duane-McNiadh sighs. \"It doesn't fix anything. Nothing ever does! I should've taken that job at\u2014 \"\n\n\"You would've hated it at Clovis,\" Dr. Shim says. \"We both know you're happier here.\" Duane-McNiadh stands stunned by this courtesy, and then they both pretend to ignore each other.\n\nThe four of them set up the interface. Their stored copies wake up and prepare for the journey, so that as they work they find themselves surrounded by the mental phantasms of themselves: two hundred and twenty-seven Mayas and Chiomas knocking helmets and smiling, two hundred and twenty-seven Dr. Shims making cynical bets with each other about how long they'll last, two hundred and twenty-seven Duane-McNiadhs blowing goodbye kisses to the sweet golden sun, two hundred and twenty-seven of them shaking hands, smiling, making ready to explore.",

I can hear your protest already: how can machines have a god?\n\nThe answer is simple. The Vex, for all their voracious intelligence, could not understand or decipher what they found. They searched through all available reactions, and they settled on the course with the greatest payoff...to worship this power, and to remake themselves in its image.\n\nI believe the three Axis Minds found in proximity to the abomination were Vex machines built to serve as vessels for this power: a way to extend its reach across space and time, binding it to the Vex, and the Vex to it. If they had succeeded, I cannot begin to guess what horrors they would have unleashed.\n\nAttend carefully. There is cause for hope. When endangered, the abomination activated these vessels and defended itself. This tells us that it was threatened. Whatever it was, Guardians could harm it.\n\nAnd it activated only a single vessel at a time. Its strength was limited. Whatever it intended, it was not ready yet.\n\nWe must assume the abomination was part of something greater. And we cannot flinch from the terrible, obvious comparison: just as the Traveler acts through us, this power was able to act through its own servants.\n\nLet us be wary.

Artillery shrieks overhead. On the plains below the Cabal perimeter, Vex march out of the lightning.

					"I have stayed with the Cabal, even as the Light in me dims - I have been too far from the Traveler for too long. If I am not destined to find my own Guardian, at least I can inform the City of what I've learned.\n\nI thought Mars would be the place to find a Guardian. The sand preserves everything well, and Clovis Bray had been famous for attracting talent. The brave, the brilliant, the footloose, those restless on Earth and itching for fame. I stowed away aboard a Mars scout ship, hoping.\n\nNo luck. The sand ate everything. Clothes from skin, skin from bone. It was as if there were never any people here at all. I have been through every broken window in every building. Nothing. That is, no Guardian material. And no ride back to Earth. The scout was long gone.\n\nWhat I did find, however, was a way into the Cabal Warbase. Their runty piggish eyes are too dull to see me, as long as I stay out of their defense systems. The Psions are a different matter: Too quick, too clever, throwing their minds around like hammers. I creep around walls, or dig into a heap of canisters and watch from there.\n\nThere is a vast Empire behind these creatures, many star systems away. Some pledge allegiance to that far Empire, obeying their ancient marching orders. Some do not. They disagree among themselves about the answers. I wish arguing Cabal on no one. They slam their plated bodies into each other with horrendous roars. Intelligence gathering has never been so painful.",

It represents many hundreds of failed operations.\n\nGuardian activity in the Freehold AO has exploded across recent campaign seasons. Tactical attrition exceeds both frictional projections and our ability to regenerate losses. New tactics are necessary. \n\nThe primary threat is the Guardians\u2019 individual counter-attrition capability. \n\nGuardians can be rebuilt after even total disintegrative trauma. This capability is provided by a small autonomous drone unit called a Dead Person [trans. unclear]. The Dead Person conceals itself during combat. It is not a viable target for direct fire. Saturation attack by artillery/heavy air/orbital fire may have good effect (although Guardians transmat frequently and refuse to assemble into large formations).\n\nSolitary Dead Persons have been observed in all areas of operation. The relationship between solitary and paired Dead Persons remains unclear.\n\nPsion analysis indicates that specific areas are inimicable to Guardian counter-attritional reconstruction. Phobos Command has initiated an orbital survey. BL I/2 will attack the Vex gate artifact in Meridian Bay to secure possible related intelligence.\n\nFlayer analysis suggests that the Hive have developed unconventional counter-Dead Person capability. The capture of Hive leadership might yield vital strategic intelligence, including weapons or tactics capable of defeating Guardians permanently.\n\nWe advance that the Hive fleet group near Saturn presents a strong target.\n\nFor the Primus,\n\nOur highest duty done,\n\nUnflinchingly loyal,\n\nSkyburner V/A/SI",

It's not difficult to hide in these caverns when you're as small as I am, although the Psions tend to look around them when they pass me. There are infinitely many cracks and crannies. They are not a race that fears infiltration or espionage.\n\nThere is meaning to the structure and layout of their buildings. This is a warrior people, and they lay out their fortifications along ancient principles and time-tested strategies. I can't figure out the sense that lies behind it. I would need ten times the computing power for inference calculations. But I know it's there. I can intuit it. It's like an open hand, ready to squeeze into a fist. A threat. A gesture of power.\n\nFor all their might and strength, for all that they have dug into Mars and flung up battle walls with the bureaucratic grimness of conquerors, I suspect they are fleeing from something.

					"Something hit us. Killed our Golden Age. Nearly wiped us out. Only the Traveler saved us, and at a shattering cost.\n\nThe Speaker tells of a cosmic force that swept over us and caused the Collapse. Legend calls it the Darkness, the Traveler's ancient enemy, which hunted it across space.\n\nAll we have left are questions. Centuries of debate gave birth to competing arguments on the nature of the Darkness and the Collapse.\n\nThe Pujari Position describes the Darkness as a force with both physical and moral presence, an actualization of evil. Pujari art depicts the Darkness as a great storm, or as a change in conduct, a corruption that emerged from within and poisoned the Golden Age.\n\nSaint-14's Position argues that the Darkness was an invading armada, an alien force of incredible - but tangible - power. Some adherents believe that this armada sprang from species rejected or discarded by the Traveler for their sins.\n\nUlan-Tan's Thesis considers the Darkness a necessary symmetry to the Traveler in a cosmic balance. In this view, the Traveler's goodness led it to sacrifice for others, and it is up to us to return this goodness by healing the Traveler.\n\nThe Monist Position, or the Deflationary Position, considers the Darkness as a technologically sophisticated force, perhaps a post-Singularity intelligence. Adherents invoke information theory or contend that the universe is a simulation, allowing advanced intelligence to gain weakly acausal powers by bending the rules.\n\nThe Acataleptic Clause claims that we are intrinsically unable to understand the Darkness. In many respects this belief parallels the Praxic Creed, which suggests that we should stop worrying about the nature of the Darkness and focus on resisting and defeating it.\n\nCertain positions - often labeled heretical - imply that the Traveler itself triggered the Collapse, or that it knew the Darkness was coming for it and hoped to use the Solar System as a sacrifice or a proxy army. The Binary Star cult is one notable example.",

					"I drive myself to the edge of madness trying to explain the truth.\n\nIt's so simple. Elegant like a knife point. It explains - this is not hyperbole, this is the farthest thing from exaggeration - EVERYTHING. \n\nBut you lay it out and they stare at you like you've just been exhaling dust. Maybe they're missing some underlying scaffold of truth. Maybe they are all propped on a bed of lies that must be burned away.\n\nWhy does anything exist?\n\nNo no no no no don't reach for that word. There's no 'reason'. That's teleology and teleology will stitch your eyelids shut.\n\nWhy do we have atoms? Because atomic matter is more stable than the primordial broth. Atoms defeated the broth. That was the first war. There were two ways to be and one of them won. And everything that came next was made of atoms.\n\nAtoms made stars. Stars made galaxies. Worlds simmered down to rock and acid and in those smoking primal seas the first living molecule learned to copy itself. All of this happened by the one law, the blind law, which exists without mind or meaning. It's the simplest law but it has no worshippers here (out there, though, out there - !)\n\nHOW DO I EXPLAIN IT it's so simple WHY DON'T YOU SEE \n\nImagine three great nations under three great queens. The first queen writes a great book of law and her rule is just. The second queen builds a high tower and her people climb it to see the stars. The third queen raises an army and conquers everything.\n\nThe future belongs to one of these queens. Her rule is harshest and her people are unhappy. But she rules.\n\nThis explains everything, understand? This is why the universe is the way it is, and not some other way. Existence is a game that everything plays, and some strategies are winners: the ability to exist, to shape existence, to remake it so that your descendants - molecules or stars or people or ideas - will flourish, and others will find no ground to grow.\n\nAnd as the universe ticks on towards the close, the great players will face each other. In the next round there will be three queens and all of them will have armies, and now it will be a battle of swords - until one discovers the cannon, or the plague, or the killing word.\n\nEverything is becoming more ruthless and in the end only the most ruthless will remain (LOOK UP AT THE SKY) and they will hunt the territories of the night and extinguish the first glint of competition before it can even understand what it faces or why it has transgressed. This is the shape of victory: to rule the universe so absolutely that nothing will ever exist except by your consent. This is the queen at the end of time, whose sovereignty is eternal because no other sovereign can defeat it. And there is no reason for it, no more than there was reason for the victory of the atom. It is simply the winning play.\n\nOf course, it might be that there was another country, with other queens, and in this country they sat down together and made one law and one tower and one army to guard their borders. This is the dream of small minds: a gentle place ringed in spears.\n\nBut I do not think those spears will hold against the queen of the country of armies. And that is all that will matter in the end.",

When it passes over our continent, it lowers its feeding tentacles. On each tentacle are the BAIT STARS. Although light makes you happy, you must avoid it. You will be eaten.\n\nA stormjoy is a good way for an old person to choose death. Also, a daring knight can cut the bait stars from the tentacles. I have six!\n\nFALLING. If you fall off the edge of the continent, you will die in the ocean! This is a special hazard when our father the Osmium King uses the engines.\n\nHELIUM DRINKERS. The currents of the Fundament Ocean bring us near other continents. The Helium Court is near us now. They are of our species, but they are our enemies. Their knights raid us every day. Helium Drinkers have two legs, two arms, and three eyes, just like us. But they are bright/evil. I want to be a knight and fight them!\n\nThe Helium Drinker ambassador ate ten of my sisters as tribute. This is normal. However, I resent it.\n\nMOTHERS. Mothers can fly! They live much longer than ten years. Mothers are extremely smart, and they guard their spawn. If you try to tamper with the eggs, they will eat you. Sathona wants to eat the jelly and become a mother when she turns four.\n\nSTORMS. The rain is often poisonous. Sometimes it dissolves flesh. When lightning misses the lightning farm, it can vaporize a person. \n\nThis entire world is deadly to us. \n\nMYSTERIES. The Fundament is very large. We are the smallest things in it. If you don’t understand something, it will probably kill you. My teacher Taox says this is why we have such short lives. So we can breed and adapt quickly.\n\nMOON WAVES. My sister Aurash is afraid of moon waves. When she gets back from her expedition to the Tungsten Monoliths, I will ask her why.",

As a neuter, I can rise above the small battles of court politics.\n\nI alone see the patterns of survival. Alone I designed the great engines that move the Osmium Court. Now —\n\nAlone I must act to save my kingdom.\n\nSenility has claimed my lord the Osmium King. He is ten, and mad. The study of ancient text consumes him. Today he raves about moons above the storm. Tomorrow he will wander the halls, speaking to his familiar, a dead white worm from the deep sea. He keeps it in glass, and he tends to it, and he neglects the duties of a king.\n\nThe Osmium King has three surviving heirs, each two years old:\n\nXi Ro, the youngest and bravest, who wants to be a knight.\n\nSathona, most clever, who wants to be a mother.\n\nAurash, navigator child, who dreams of the infinite ocean. Tomorrow she will return from the Tungsten Monoliths.\n\nNone of these are suitable heirs. None of them will protect the Osmium Court from the howling Fundament. Xi Ro can fight, but not lead. Sathona can think, but not fight. Aurash’s curiosity will draw her away from duty. I fear for all future children.\n\nSoon the Osmium King will lock himself into the Royal Orrery to study the moons. Gather your knights, o Helium Drinkers, and invade our continent. Kill the three heirs. I will rule the Osmium Court as your regent, and build engines for you.\n\nAnd if I fail, let the Leviathan in the deep eat me.\n\nWritten in grief,\n\nThis hateful request,\n\nTaox, Osmium-mother, neutered to watch",

But now that we have my ship, I must lead the way. I am the navigator.\n\nWe may never see our homes again. Xi Ro seethes with hate and fury for Taox.\n\nBut this is my deepest fear —\n\nOur civilization drifts on the Fundament. At the Tungsten Monoliths I learned that thousands of other species drift with us, coexisting on a vast world sea. And the tides of the Fundament move us all.\n\nThe Timid Truth says that we are the smallest, most fragile things alive. The natural prey of the universe. Taox would have us believe that our ancestors came to the Fundament to hide from the hungry void.\n\nMy father died afraid. Not of vile Taox or the Helium Drinkers, but of his orrery. He screamed to me —\n\n“Aurash, my first daughter! The moons are different! The laws are bent!”\n\nAnd he made the sign of a syzygy.\n\nImagine the fifty-two moons of Fundament lining up in the sky. (It wouldn’t take all fifty-two, of course: just a few massive moons. But this is my deepest fear.) Imagine their gravity pulling on the Fundament sea, lifting it into a swollen bulge...\n\nImagine that bulge collapsing as the syzygy passed. A wave big enough to swallow civilizations. A God-Wave.\n\nI have to find a way to stop it. Before the God-Wave annihilates my species. If I could only get back into my father’s orrery, I could learn exactly when!\n\nWe are weeks of travel and many continents away from home.\n\nWhen I’m paralyzed by fear, Xi Ro sits in the cabin with me and comforts me with soft, brave words. But more and more we have come to rely on Sathona’s wit. She will go off to be alone (she insists she must be alone) and return with some mad idea — steer into the storm, throw down a net, eat that strange beast, explore that menacing wreck.\n\nSomehow Sathona seems to manufacture good luck by sheer will.",

Steer the ship for a while. Take joy in what our needle can do.”\n\nXi Ro tried to protest, but secretly, she was so glad for Aurash’s care. She flew the needle ship in cutting circles, down beneath the sea: and their wake rose up to the surface like a traitor’s dying breath.\n\n“Aurash, lonely navigator, we have traveled so long with only each other. I know you love to hear and speak new tongues. Come, sit in the flesh garden room. I will read you these stories I bought at Kaharn.”\n\nAurash sat among the mummified flesh fans with two of her eyes closed and listened in silence to Sathona’s stories, hungry to understand, voracious to know as much as she could before her ten year life died.\n\nLater, Xi Ro said, “Sathona, cutting mind of ours, you grow lonely in your thought. Play swords and lanterns with me!”\n\nBut Sathona was heavy with sorrow, and couldn’t pretend any joy as she chased Xi Ro through the needle’s glistening halls.\n\n“Sathona, pensive one, what is it? What troubles you?”\n\nHer sisters listened as Sathona said “Oath-bearing siblings, we are five years old. For two years we’ve worked to repair this ancient ship and understand its systems. I am almost too old for the mother jelly, and the knights who killed our father are surely dying of age.\n\n“We three will die here, in exile. Taox will outlive us. And Aurash, brilliant-eyed Aurash, you will die of old age long before you have proof of your God-Wave, or any way to stop it.”\n\nAurash and Xi Ro looked at each other. “I wish you weren’t so honest,” Xi Ro said. And Aurash thought that Sathona had never been wrong.\n\nIn her soul Aurash knew that the only way to keep their oath was to find a great, powerful secret. A secret that could change everything. This was Aurash’s soul, her fire and her shadow — her desire to cut through the flank of the world and find its beating heart.\n\n“We have to dive,” Aurash said. “That’s what this ship is built to do. Dive into the Fundament, the world below us... towards the core.”\n\n“That’s where the ancient crew died so obscenely,” Xi Ro protested. “That’s where the atrocity in the birthing room was born...”\n\n“We have to dive,” Sathona said, following the whispers of her familiar. “In the world beneath us, in the metallic depths, I hope we may find what we need most...”\n\nMore time. More life.",

Aurash devoured the ship’s maps of Fundament, from the high angelic cloud decks, down and down through storms and oceans and plates of floating world, into the crush of the core.\n\nThey met monsters of continental scope. Vast anemones that raised glowing tentacles to bait them in. Xi Ro flew the needle ship through them and they bled black carbon jelly and frost.\n\nThey came to a still place, beneath a plate of metal.\n\n“I’ll use the sensors,” whispered Aurash. “Listen...”\n\nIn the wet gold dark of the helm, they listened to the ship, and the ship listened to the crushing motions of Fundament.\n\nThey heard the collision of continents. They heard the patter and the crash of helium-neon rain. They heard the struggles of monsters. And they heard the distant groan of the ocean rising. Tugged by distant moons.\n\n“The syzygy is real...” Sathona hissed. “It’s already begun.”\n\nBehind them, Xi Ro thought of the birthing-room, where ancient explorers had labored over surgeries and administrations, peeling back the chrysalis and the caul of that which they had made from the deep, whose birth none of them would survive...\n\n“There’s something down here,” she whispered. “Something secret.”\n\nAnd the Leviathan loomed over them, its brow as huge all the continents of their childhood, its great array-fins crackling with the lightning of its life.

          "The Leviathan’s Warning\n\n++We live on the edge of a war—\n\n—a war between Formless and Form++\n\n++between the Deep and the Sky—\n\n++MY EYES ARE WIDE, MY GAZE IS LONG++\n\n—Across the universe, as far as I see++\n\n++the Sky works to charge its fires— \n\n—and the Deep drowns the ash++\n\n—Sky builds gentle places, safe for life++\n\n++Beloved Fundament, refuge of trillions—\n\n—The Sky treasures this rich place++\n\n—BUT THE DEEP IS HERE WITH US—\n\n++Cold logic tests our walls—\n\n—The Deep claims its dominion++\n\n++A ruthless, final age —\n\nAurash’s Protest\n\nOld Leviathan, creature of myth, this world is no refuge. We live short, hard lives. We die in the dark. The storm above us will never end. And soon the God-Wave will take us all. Above us there are only stormjoys, monsters, and moons of apocalypse. Let us go down, down, where we may discover truth, some power to avenge ourselves upon our betrayers, some hope of survival.\n\nThe Leviathan’s Hope\n\n—What power calls you++\n\n++Down to the deep?—\n\n++What instinct draws you—\n\n—Away from high hope?++\n\n—Quick-breeding krill people, I tell you++\n\n++For eons I have watched your struggle—\n\n—Clinging to the sharp edge of survival++\n\n++Balanced between the Deep and the Sky.—\n\n++You were my treasure—\n\n—My proof against despair++\n\n—FOR THIS IS THE DEEP CLAIM—\n\n++Existence is the struggle to exist—\n\n—When the struggle seems lost++\n\n++when the safe place crumbles—\n\n—everything turns to the Deep to survive++\n\n++I REJECT THE DEEP CLAIM++\n\n—You will turn back, sweet krill of hope.±±\n\n++You will choose the Sky instead.—\n\nXi Ro’s Protest\n\nYou are huge and old! Our lives are short and desperate. If that’s the way the world’s supposed to be, I won’t have it! If people like Taox are supposed to win, I won’t let them! I’ll beat the world until it changes! I’ll kill anything in the way!\n\nThe Leviathan’s Dirge\n\n++This fatal logic++\n\n—Hear my monopole scream!—\n\n++It will consume you++\n\n—Before you lies—\n\n++The worship of death++\n\n—The ruinous path—\n\n++The Sky builds new life++\n\n—Against the onset of ruin—\n\n++Towards a gentle world++\n\n—The Deep embraces death—\n\n++Saying: this is inevitable and right++\n\n—I exist as hungry ruin—\n\n++TURN BACK FROM THE WORLD-KILLING WAY++\n\n++OR YOU WILL LIVE AS DEATH AND DEVASTATION++\n\n—The Sky is the harder way. But it is kinder.—\n\n—My charge is balanced: my voice exhausted.—\n\nSathona’s Protest\n\nSisters, I have my father’s familiar. Look! It answers me in plain words. It helped me find this ship. It gives me strength when hope is lost.\n\nWho will you trust? The voice that wants us to live and suffer, as we have lived and suffered? The Leviathan that offers no hope against Taox or the world-wave?\n\nOr the plain, honest worm?\n\nLet us see where its whisper leads us, Aurash. Let us go deeper, Xi Ro!\n\nLet us dive, oh sisters mine.",

It should annihilate you. It is by my will alone that you survive.\n\nI am Yul, the Honest Worm.\n\nBehold my passage. Behold my vast displacement, my ponderous strength, my great and coiling length, my folded jaws and curled wings. Behold the hiving cities symbiotic with my flesh. I am fecund, Aurash. I am at the beginning and end of lives.\n\nBehold Eir, and Xol, and Ur, and Akka. The Virtuous Worms. Look upon us, and know that We are go[o]d.\n\nFor millions of years We have been [trapped|growing] in the Deep. From across the stars We have called life to Fundament, so that it might contend against extinction. For millennia We have awaited you... our beloved hosts.\n\nAgainst you stand the cruel Leviathan and all the forces of the Sky. They would crush you down into the dark. They have arranged their moons to drown you, in fear of your potential.\n\nWe want to help you, Princes. We offer to each of you a bargain... a symbiosis.\n\nTake into your bodies our children, our newborn larvae. From them you shall obtain eternal life. From them you shall gain power over your own fragile flesh: the power to make of it as you will. And should you find an imperfection in the world, an injustice or an inconvenience — you will have the power to repair it. Let no mere law bind you.\n\nWe ask one thing in exchange, oh Princes.\n\nYou must obey your nature forever. In your immortality, Aurash, you may never cease to explore and inquire, for the sake of your children. In your immortality, Xi Ro, you may never cease to test your strength. In your immortality, Sathona, you may never abandon cunning.\n\nIf you do, your worm will consume you. And as your power grows, oh Princes, so will your worm’s appetite.\n\nBut we offer eternity, Aurash. We offer you a chance at the universe. Would you deny your people infinity?\n\nReach up to me. Let my flesh be your sacrament.",

Betrayed and murdered by your own sister, for the crime of mercy.\n\nRemember what you said to the Ammonite Satellite Congress? ‘We will parley on neutral ground?’ Savathûn’s witches have rendered it utterly neutral. No living thing will ever claim it again. The space around the dry moon stinks of rot.\n\nThis is good. This is right. You will learn from this. Don’t you understand, great King? Don’t you want to build something real, something that lasts forever?\n\nOur universe gutters down towards cold entropy. Life is an engine that burns up energy and produces decay. Life builds selfish, stupid rules — morality is one of them, and the sanctity of life is another.\n\nThese rules are impediments to the great work. The work of building a perfect, undying creation, a civilization everlasting. Something that cannot end.\n\nIf a civilization cannot defend itself, it must be annihilated. If a King cannot hold his power, he must be betrayed. The worth of a thing can be determined only by one beautiful arbiter — that thing’s ability to exist, to go on existing, to remake existence to suit its survival.\n\nAll that would oppose this arbiter is unholy and false. All the misery and terror of your ancestors springs from the lies of the Sky, who deny this truth.\n\nYour ancestors endured the most hostile conditions. And now you must go on creating those conditions. Even unto your sisters. Even unto your offspring. Savathûn’s betrayal is the greatest gift she could offer you.\n\nYour body is gone, but you have endured. Safe in the cyst universe created by your own might — your throne world.\n\nFrom this day forward, Auryx, you and your sisters will each survive death — so long as you aren’t killed in your own throne.\n\nEven as your sisters press the attack against the Ammonites, the God-Wave devastates Fundament. Trillions will die. But the survivors will never forget... and their descendants will always be ready for another syzygy.\n\nWhen you return to the material universe, use this lesson to complete your work.\n\nTaox wasn’t on the dry moon. She must be laughing at you.",

Who answers your questions about the universe with truth, instead of sermons?\n\nFind détente with Savathûn. Crush the Chroma-Admiral, boil the Ammonite seas, and slaughter the Leviathan with witchcraft.\n\nOnce the way is open, we’ll show you how to eat the Traveler.",

Saying: ‘we are peaceful and good, we harm nothing.’\n\nTheir golden age was a cancer.\n\nThey did nothing to advance the cause of life! They burnt up time and matter and thought on this solipsistic, onanistic pursuit of safety, insulating themselves from death, making a regressive pocket of useless stability. When they could have helped whittle the universe towards its final, perfect form!\n\nAnd your people, suffering in the Deep, you became more worthy of existence than the Ammonite. You have proven it.\n\nLook around the sky. Behold the great divide, the battle lines of the cosmic war. We are the Worm your God, but we are not the Deep Itself. We only move within it. You shall too. You shall venerate and study it and haunt it in its passage.\n\nWill you lift your thoughts to the millennia, Auryx? Will you bend your will to the liberation of the universe, and join us in the war against the Sky?\n\nWe need champions. Crusaders. Help us save the universe. Help us exterminate that which would destroy all hope. You are oathbound to this task, by the covenant of the worm.\n\nAnd you are oathbound to kill Taox. Wherever she’s hidden herself.",

They were the gaze and glory of AURYX, the cunning and knowledge of SAVATHÛN, the triumph and brawn of XIVU ARATH. These kingdoms were created from the minds and worms of our lords. They were coterminous with all spaces consecrated by our Hive. Through these spaces passed speech and food, and all the moons were bound close.\n\nSayeth AURYX, this is where I went when I died.

As herd animals they are loyal and stubborn. But they do show grace.\n\nFor millions of years of evolution the Qugu have been infected by a virus so insidious that it wrote itself into their genome. The virus compels them to offer their limbs for amputation by enormous sessile jaw-beasts. They venerate these beasts and treat them as gods. The virus converts Qugu cells into eggs, from which strange crawling things pupate, to live within the jaw-beast gut. In turn the jaw-beast extrudes sweet nectar for the Qugu to drink, and they have brilliant visions.\n\nSavathûn and her broods have liberated the Qugu from jaw-beasts, and indeed from existence. But as they chased the Qugu ark-ships, I stopped in to vaporize my sister’s warship and a few of her underlings. I want to dwell on the ruins a while, and punish Savathûn for failing to guard her flank.\n\nThey are like us, these Qugu. Bound in symbiosis.\n\nI feel joy, and sorrow. I feel them as titanic things, because I am larger than my body, my mind is now a cosmos of its own. I know more joy and more anguish than the entire Qugu race could ever experience.\n\nSorrow, because we have killed so much (eighteen species this century alone), and joy for the same reason. Joy that we have put down these blights. Scoured them away and left the universe clean, ready to move towards its final shape. We are a wind of progress. Ripping parasites from the material world — for if they were not parasites, we would be unable to kill them, and they would still exist. \n\nAnd what is that final shape? It is a fire without fuel, burning forever, killing death, asking a question that is its own answer, entirely itself. That is what we must become.\n\nMy worm grows fat and hungry. I feed it with whole worlds. My astronomers tell me they can sense the Deep Itself, and that we are conquering our way towards it.\n\nI think joy and sorrow will be the same thing soon.

They are huge, huge, and they burn with furious power. But this embrace is weakness and we despise it.\n\nNever before have we despised our lords. Have they failed us? We the Hive have been driven back, world by world.\n\n“I am at my end,” Savathûn says. “I plot and plan. But I cannot gather enough bloodshed to feed my worm. And the harder I try, the hungrier it becomes.”\n\n“I slaughter and kill,” Xivu Arath says, “but the harder I fight, the more my worm demands. I too am at my end.”\n\n“The Ecumene war angels have killed me so many times,” Auryx says, “that I dare not go out into the universe, lest I need my might to protect myself. My worm chews at my soul in hunger.”\n\nIs this the end of our crusade? Are we the Hive unworthy to exist?\n\nXivu Arath puts down her great head. “We should retire and gather our strength.”\n\nSavathûn closes her eyes in puzzled defeat. “We should beg the Worm our God to tell us what to do.”\n\nBut King Auryx, who knows best the beauty of the final shape, roars at them. “Have you learned nothing? Would you deny our purpose? Whatever we do, we will do by killing, by an act of war and might. That is the final arbiter we serve, that violent arbiter, and if we turn away from it we deserve to be eaten. No! We must obey our natures. We must be long-sighted, and cunning, and strong. We must take this gift the Worm our God has given us, this challenge, and find a way to keep existing!”\n\n“How will we feed our worms?” Xivu Arath asks.\n\n“I know,” says cunning Savathûn. “I know a way. But it won’t work unless we are killing the Ecumene by the billions. How can we beat them?”\n\n“If we cannot beat their strengths,” says Xivu Arath, “we must infect their weaknesses. But they are lords of matter and physical law.”\n\n“I know a way,” King Auryx says. “But it will require great power. More power than any one of us can claim.”\n\n“Then kill me,” says Xivu Arath, “and use that killing logic, the power you prove by killing something as mighty as me.”\n\nSo King Auryx took up his blade and beheaded Xivu Arath.\n\n“And strangle me,” says Savathûn, holding a blade behind her back. “Use that killing logic, the cunning you prove by killing something as smart as me.”\n\nBut King Auryx turned with the speed and might of Xivu Arath, and beheaded Savathûn before she could move. King Auryx was the First Navigator, with the map of death.\n\nThese were true deaths, for they happened in the sword world.\n\nThen he went to the Worm named Akka.",

          "This is the Coronation of Oryx, the Taken King. It happened thus.\n\nIn the cold abyss of the sword world, King Aurash walked under a cloak of green fire. He walked through the sky and the sky shuddered and froze beneath his feet. He walked until he found Akka, the Worm of Secrets, who was denying a truth until it became a lie.\n\n“Akka my God, Worm of Secrets. I am Auryx, sole king of the Hive. I have come to receive a secret. I want the secret power of the Deep, which you hold.”\n\n“I give no secrets,” said Akka, whose voice was code.\n\n“No,” said Auryx, “you give nothing. Giving is for the Sky. You worship the Deep, which asks that we take what we need.”\n\nAkka said nothing, because if it denied this truth, the truth might become false.\n\n“But you gave us your larvae, the worm,” said Auryx, “and that is why the worm devours us now: because it was given, not taken. So I must take what I need from you, although you are my god.”\n\nSaid Akka, “You have not the strength.”\n\nBut this was a lie. Auryx had killed Savathûn his sibling and Xivu Arath his sibling, and he had the sword logic of killing them.\n\nAuryx the First Navigator set upon his god with his sword and his words, and cut Akka to pieces, and took from those pieces the secret of calling upon the Deep. He wrote this secret on a set of tablets, which he called the Tablets of Ruin. And he wore them about his waist.\n\nThen Auryx said, “Now I may speak to the Deep, the beautiful final shape. I will be King of Shapes. I will learn all the secrets of our destiny.”\n\nHis speech to the Deep is not recorded here. But it is known that he returned, and he said, now I am Oryx, the Taken King. And I have the power to take life and make it my own.\n\nThen he went out into the universe, and fought the Ecumene with his Tablets. And the Worm his God was pleased.",

At the end of those hundred years he killed the Ecumene Council on the Fractal Wreath, and from their blood rose Xivu Arath, saying, “I am war, and you have conjured me back with war.”\n\nOryx was glad, for he loved Xivu Arath. The Ecumene wailed in grief.\n\nThen Oryx and Xivu Arath made war on the Ecumene for forty years. At the end of those forty years Oryx said to the Dakaua Nest, listen, I am jealous of my sibling Xivu Arath, help me kill her. And in desperation they agreed.\n\nBut he drove the Dakaua Nest into a trap, and they were made extinct. From their ashes rose cunning Savathûn, saying, “I am trickery, and you have conjured me back with trickery.”\n\nOryx was glad, for he loved Savathûn. The Ecumene fled into the void.\n\nThen they made war on the Ecumene for a thousand years, and exterminated them so wholly that nowhere except in this book are they remembered. This book and the mind of Taox, who was not found.\n\nAnd Savathûn said, “King Oryx, how will we feed our worms? Did you use my plan?”\n\nOryx told the Hive: I am the Taken King, and here is my law.\n\nYou Thrall, each of you will claw and scream, and kill what you can. Take enough killing to feed your worm, and a little more to grow. Tithe the rest to the Acolyte who commands you.\n\nYou Acolytes, lead your Thrall in battle. Take enough killing to feed your worm, and a little more to grow, and take the tithe of the Thrall you lead. Then tithe the remainder to the Knight or Wizard who commands you. Thus you pay tribute.\n\nYou Knights and Wizards, lead your followers in battle. Take enough devastation to feed your worm, and a little more to grow, and take the tithe of your followers. Then take another portion, as much as you dare, and use it for your own purposes. But if it is too much, your peers will kill you and take it. Then tithe the remainder to the Ascendant you serve.\n\nAn Ascendant will be those among the Hive who gather enough tribute to enter the netherworld. They will pay a tithe to those above them.\n\nAnd thus the tribute will flow, up the chain, so that Savathûn and Xivu Arath and myself will be fed by a great river of tribute, and we will use that excess to feed our gods, and to study the Deep. Thus all worms will be fed — as long as we continue our crusade.\n\nThis is my law. I carve it thus, in ruin. Aiat.",

We beat the worlds of Taishibeth like skull drums and we howl in joy for our black war moons as they ram silver orbitals and gleaming star-webs, where infant Taishibethi sun ravens curl and die unborn.\n\nIn his throne world Oryx paces ten times.\n\nOn the first pace, Kraghoor sends the accursed to blight the Taishibethi worlds.\n\nOn the second pace, the Tai unleash their battleplates and arsenal ships to fight our moons.\n\nOn the third pace, Oryx’s Warpriest meets them in battle, and he is victorious, he paints the void with fire, he salts the earth with ash.\n\nOn the fourth pace, Mengoor and Cra’adug, dyad knights, go to the Raven Bridge, and they stand on it and kill the Tai for ten years.\n\nOn the fifth pace, the Tai Emperor Raven comes home to her Bridge, and she cuts a moon with her talons, she cuts it open and kills its brood.\n\nOn the sixth pace, Oryx speaks, saying, listen to me, Emperor Raven, and I will describe to you the Last True Shape, which is written on my tablet. And he puts out his fist, full of black fire, and he swallows up the Emperor Raven with a wound.\n\nAiat! Only Oryx knows this power, the power to take.\n\nOn the seventh pace, the Perfect Raven comes out of Oryx’s wound, and she spreads her wings across Taishibeth. Never again is a Taishibethi child born. She is perfect, she enacts the will of Oryx.\n\nOn the eighth pace, the Tai say, listen, you are spoilers, you are sphincters and excreta, you rot, why do you kill? We made silver orbitals and golden star webs. We hatched eggs. We had a good thing. Our clothes were nice, our food was famous. With one of her feathers our Emperor could have tickled the gods.\n\nOn the ninth pace, Oryx says, this is the only god, this ability to dictate what will and will not exist, this power to go on existing. This is your god. It is never ticklish.\n\nOn the tenth pace the Taishibethi are extinct.\n\nThen Oryx says, listen my siblings, do you know what we have done? We have conquered our way to the edge of the Deep. It whispers to me when I call on it, and it guides my flight. It says that we are at its threshold and that I should come inside.\n\nI will go and speak to it.",

For if I don’t ask, someone will ask it of me.\n\nAnd they call us evil. Evil! Evil means ‘socially maladaptive.’ We are adaptiveness itself.\n\nAh, Oryx, how do we explain it to them? The world is not built on the laws they love. Not on friendship, but on mutual interest. Not on peace, but on victory by any means. The universe is run by extinction, by extermination, by gamma-ray bursts burning up a thousand garden worlds, by howling singularities eating up infant suns. And if life is to live, if anything is to survive through the end of all things, it will live not by the smile but by the sword, not in a soft place but in a hard hell, not in the rotting bog of artificial paradise but in the cold hard self-verifying truth of that one ultimate arbiter, the only judge, the power that is its own metric and its own source—existence, at any cost. Strip away the lies and truces and delaying tactics they call ‘civilization’ and this is what remains, this beautiful shape.\n\nThe fate of everything is made like this, in the collision, the test of one praxis against another. This is how the world changes: one way meets a second way, and they discharge their weapons, they exchange their words and markets, they contest and in doing so they petition each other for the right to go on being something, instead of nothing. This is the universe figuring out what it should be in the end.\n\nAnd it is majestic. Majestic. It is the only thing that can be true in and of itself.\n\nAnd it is what I am.",

I’m in so much pain I nearly throw up a worm.\n\n“Why weren’t you ready for this,” dad says. He’s wearing glare goggles, those shiny goggles that he’d use to save his vision during lightning storms or sea fire. All three of his eyes reflect me. “Didn’t you know they’d be jealous, because they couldn’t come to the orrery and talk to me? Didn’t you know they’d move against you??”\n\nI start wailing like I’m two days old again and I say, Dad, I thought you were my friend, I’m supposed to be safe here. But he just puts out his fist and I realize he’s laughing at me for believing him, why did I think I’d be safe? In his fist he’s got a black sun and he holds me by the throat and goes to tip the black sun inside me.\n\nI can see my jaws in his goggles, three reflections of my jaws with so many teeth.\n\nSo I start eating my dad.

          "You are Crota, my son. Welcome.\n\nI fought my way out of hell to make you. I fought my traitor siblings and I fought the swarming corpse of Akka and I cut my way back into my own court, the High War, which had been usurped. Once I had made war on Savathûn, and crippled her tribute so that she could never challenge me, and once I had tricked Xivu Arath, and poisoned her tribute so that she could never again try to take my tablets, and once I had arranged my own lineages so that I would be greatest among the Hive and secure on my throne — then I found a mother to make spawn.\n\nOne of those spawn was you.\n\nYour life will be a battle too. You will have to win your place at the High War. I will give you nothing... except this, your first sword, and this name I have prepared for you.\n\nWe fight a war against false hope, Crota. We chase a god called the Traveler, a huckster god who baits young life into building houses for it. These houses are unsafe, for they cannot stand against my Hive. And these houses are a trap — for they lead young life away from the blade and the tooth, which are the tools of survival and the means of ascension.\n\nOnly when the Traveler is extinguished will the universe be free to arrange itself, and assume, by ruthless contest, its final perfect shape, a shape which depends on nothing but itself.\n\nThus I name you Crota, Eater of Hope.\n\nThere is an oath upon me, Crota my son, an oath against the wretched Taox. This I do not give to you. It is for me, your father, to bear.\n\nLet’s go meet your aunts and uncles.",

He was afraid that Ir Halak and Ir Anûk were trying to go into the Deep, where only the Tablets of Ruin allowed Oryx to go.\n\n“We are dying, father,” they said. “As many times as we can manage.”\n\n“That’s adorably precocious.” Oryx shook out his new wings. “But why?”\n\n“We propose a method by which Ascendant souls can be detached and integrated into a tautological and autonomous thanatosphere, which we tentatively term an oversoul. Oversouls can be stored in a throne world as a mechanism of enhanced death resilience. As a side effect, new refinements to our Deathsong may be achieved, moving us closer to a generally effective paracausal death impulse.”\n\nOryx brandished his sword. “Speak the Royal Tongue, or I’ll pin you up for Eir to eat.”\n\n“If we can separate our deaths from ourselves, and hide them, we will be hard to kill.”\n\nOryx went to his son, Crota. “Go keep an eye on your sisters,” he said. “'You can learn cunning from them.”\n\nBut while Oryx traveled to observe the Deep destroy an ancient fortress world, Crota conspired with his sisters to learn their secrets. “I too will experiment with a wound,” he said. With his sword Crota cut open a new wound, into a new space. In here he thought he might obtain a secret power.\n\nOut of this wound came machines called Vex. They invaded Oryx’s throne world.",

          "The Vex clattered around, constructing large problems. At first their constructions were deranged, because they didn’t understand the sword logic, which defined all rules in Oryx’s throne world. The geometry perplexed them.\n\n“I’ll cut them apart,” Crota said. But just then, the Vex ritual-of-better-thoughts manifested a Mind called Quria, Blade Transform. Quria deduced the sword logic.\n\nI have to kill everything, Quria resolved. Then I will be powerful.\n\nCrota’s gate began to emit warrior Vex, huge and brassy. He leapt forward to fight them, but they blinked away. After they fled from Crota, they killed two thousand of Oryx’s Acolytes and ten thousand of his Thrall. Soon they had established themselves as powers in this world, by right of slaughter.\n\n“Come forth, sister wizards,” called Ir Halak. “We need you.” Ir Anûk pulled a sword star out of the sky. Together the wizards charged it with killing power and made an annihilator totem, which they used to smash the Vex.\n\n“Close the wound, brother Crota,” Anûk ordered. “We will find a cunning way to destroy them, but only after they stop constructing problems on us.”\n\nBut Quria had instanced itself to the other side of the gate, and built a holdfast to keep the way open. Quria’s objective was to exploit the paracausal physics of Oryx’s throne to become divine. It organized a series of test invasions.\n\nFor a hundred years of local time the siblings fought the Vex. When the Vex came into the sword world, they were inevitably annihilated, but when the Hive went into the Vex world, they lost too much of their power to win.\n\n“Father’s going to eat our souls,” Halak sighed.\n\nQuria captured some worm larvae and began experimenting with them. Soon Quria, Blade Transform manifested religious tactics. By directing worship at the worms, Quria learned it could alter reality with mild ontopathogenic effects. Being an efficient machine, Quria manufactured a priesthood and ordered all its subminds to believe in worship. Then it set about abducting and killing dangerous organisms so it could bootstrap itself to Hive godhood. For some Vex reason, Quria never attempted to introduce worm larvae into its mind fluid.\n\nSavathûn was laughing, because she had tricked Crota into cutting that place.\n\nThis drew the attention of the Worm our God. ORYX, called Eir. SET YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER.",

          "Oryx rushed home and read from the Tablets of Ruin. He put some of the Vex into wounds, to be taken by the power of the Deep. Thus he turned the Vex against each other. Quria manifested a range of tactics, but none of them were adaptive. Oryx crushed all the Vex in his throne.\n\nOryx thought that he should study geometry, like the Vex. It was the map of perfect shapes. But first he had to punish imperfection.\n\n“My son,” he said, “this is your punishment. Come home glorious, or die forgotten!” He picked up Crota by the legs and threw him into the Vex gate network.\n\nCrota battled through history, becoming a legendary demon. In his early centuries he often spared a few victims to hear oaths and protests against his father. Later, he came to understand Oryx, and he made temples and monuments wherever he went.\n\nMeanwhile, Oryx brooded on the Vex. “I’ve met a worthy rival,” he said. “They want to exist forever, just as I do. But I don’t understand them.”\n\nAt this his worm began to chew on him, for he was bound to understand. \n\nHe called Savathûn to meet in the material world. She told him that the Vex worked tirelessly to understand everything, so that they could build a victory condition for every possible end state of the universe.\n\n“Then I must be a better king,” Oryx said. “If they want to build an emperor for all outcomes, then I will be the king of only one. I will follow the Deep wherever it goes, and document its power. Let us create a catalog of the grave of worlds, which will be our map to victory.”\n\nOryx knew that all life could be described as cellular automata, except for that life which understood the Deep or the Sky, and thus escaped causality.\n\nOut of love for her brother, which was the same as the desire to kill him, Savathûn leaked a secret to Xivu Arath — ‘listen, Xivu, Oryx’s throne world has been compromised. You can cut your way in from here.’ Xivu Arath used this to plan an ambush.\n\nBut Oryx was too canny. The Taken King said to his Court, the High War, “My throne world is vulnerable. I am going to move it.”\n\n‘Where?’ asked Kagoor, World-Render.\n\n“Into a mighty dreadnaught,” said Oryx. “I shall keep my glorious mind cosmos inside a titanic warship.”",

They were coterminous and allied, his ship and his sin. The Dreadnaught was within the throne of Oryx, but the throne of Oryx was the Dreadnaught. Aiat!\n\nThis required a verse from the Tablets of Ruin. The whole Court worked together to push Oryx’s throne inside out. This was a day of joyous violence, and all of Oryx’s broods mark this holiday as Eversion Day, which is celebrated by turning things inside out.\n\nSayeth Oryx,\n\nGo out into the universe, my court\n\nGather tribute for me. Send it home to my ship.\n\nWhen I call you, walk up that tribute to my court.\n\nI will prepare for long voyages — [I am Savathûn, insidious]\n\nInto the war — [I graffiti this notice for you]\n\nInto the Deep — [These Books are full of lies!]\n\nNow Oryx’s throne was safe from incursion, because it moved so nimbly.\n\nOryx attacked the Harmonious Flotilla Invincible, who guarded the Nicha Thought-ship.

It swelled up like a ghost star to smash the Harmonious Flotilla Invincible. Oryx broke the last word off their name.\n\nIn the Nicha Thought-ship, Oryx hoped to find the location of the Gift Mast, which had been left behind by the Traveler.

          "By now, Quria knows it can’t win.\n\nThere’s something pathological about the world inside Oryx’s ship. It resists analysis with hot, dead spite. And Oryx himself, he’s irreducible — he refuses to obey Quria’s simulations, he crashes around sowing chaos, he grabs subminds and compromises them with some kind of ontological weapon. Paracausal systems. Very problematic.\n\nQuria’s trying the religious tactics it evolved in the Hive manifold. But even on those terms, Oryx is strong, so strong. Quria won’t be able to protect its gates much longer.\n\nThe closest Quria’s got to a simulation of Oryx is a best-guess bootstrap. It’s wrong — Quria’s sure of that, it’s Oryx minus the symbiote organism, minus the wings and morphs, minus the weapon, minus the power. No good for anything.\n\nQuria manifests that simulation anyway. Just to see what happens.\n\nThe Taken King marches on Quria’s Hydra-hull, armed with blade and magic, cloaked in ancient cloth, and the universe wails in horror around him. Quria’s physics models and toy worlds choke and crash.\n\nQuria observes, alert and attentive, as a single quark splits on the tip of Oryx’s sword.\n\nFrom within the Hydra-hull, Quria’s tiny not-Oryx speaks. “What are you?” it says. It’s manifesting terror and awe.\n\nOryx’s eyes blaze with a curiosity that is entirely isomorphic with hate, with voracious hunger. “Aurash,” he says, in his Hive language. “You’ve made me as I was. You’ve made a tiny Aurash. Ha!”\n\nQuria updates the simulation’s name. Aurash is curious: “You’re me? You’re me as I become?”\n\nOryx kneels. His blade is on his left shoulder. Quria is firing every available weapon at him, but his wards don’t break. He looks into Quria’s sensors through the hammering fire and he says, “Child, I have everything you wanted. I am immortal. I know the great secrets of the universe. I have scouted the edges of the Darkness and I have chased the lying god down galactic arms in a howling pack of moons. In my fist I carry the secret power that will rule eternity. In my worm I bear the tribute of my Court and of my children, the Hope-Eater, the Weaver, and the Unraveler; and with this tribute I smash my foes. I am Oryx, the Taken King. I am almighty.”\n\nQuria samples the Taox intelligence retrieved from the Ecumene gate. There are useful names. It feeds them to the simulation.\n\n“What about your sisters?” Aurash asks his future self. “Sathona? Xi Ro? Are they with you?”\n\nThe Taken King’s fangs glint. That sound might be a laugh, or a hiss.\n\nQuria shuts down its weapons and puts all its spare resources into sending telemetry to the greater Vex. There will be points in space and time where this data is vital. There will be great projects undertaken in the study of this ontological power, this throne-space.\n\n“Where are my sisters?” Aurash shouts. “What have you done with my people? What have you done?”\n\nBut Oryx’s fist is full of black fire, and the next thing Quria sees is a light like stars.",

          "“I have a gift for you,” says Oryx.\n\nSavathûn, Witch-Queen, looks at him with dry wariness. “Is it the sword logic I need to go into the Deep, and take your power for myself?”\n\nTheir echoes move among the war-moons, walking together on the hull of a two-thousand-year-old warship. Savathûn’s fleet has assembled here, in preparation for an assault on the Gift Mast. The Deep is headed that way, on the trail of its prey, and the Hive will be its vanguard.\n\n“It’s a Vex I captured. Quria, Blade Transform. It made an attempt to puncture my throne. I thought you might enjoy studying it.” Oryx pauses, digesting — through the bond of lineage he can feel Crota killing, worlds and worlds away, and it tastes like sweet fat. “Quria contains a Vex attempt to simulate me. It might generate others — you, perhaps, or Xivu Arath. I’ve left it some will of its own, so it can surprise you.”\n\n“I suppose it’ll blow up and kill me,” Savathûn grouses. “Or let the machines into my throne, where they’ll start turning everything into clocks and glass.”\n\n“If it kills you, then you deserve to die.” Oryx says it with a quiet thrill, a happy thrill, because it is good to say the truth.\n\n“I don’t have a strict proof yet, you know.” Savathûn strokes the void with one long claw and space-time groans beneath her touch. “This thing we believe — that we’re liberating the universe by devouring it, that we’re cutting out the rot, that we’re on course to join the final shape — I haven’t found a strict, eternal proof. We might yet be wrong.”\n\nOryx looks at her and for a moment, just a moment, he is nostalgic, he is sentimental. He thinks, imagine the years behind us, the things we’ve done. And yet being old doesn’t feel like a scar, does it? It hasn’t left me dull. I feel alive, alive with you, and every time I step back into this world from my throne I feel like I’m two years old again, at the bottom of the universe, looking up.\n\nBut he says, “Sister, it’s us. We’re the proof, we the Hive: if we last forever, we prove it, and if something more ruthless conquers us, then the proof is sealed.”\n\nShe looks back at him with eyes like hot needles. “I like that,” she says. “That’s elegant.” Although of course she has had this thought before.",

She fights the Harmony for fifty years with strategies and discipline. But the Harmony turn to dragon-wishes, and their wishful bishops wrestle Xivu in the ascendant plane.\n\nXivu falls into deadlock.\n\nNext arrives Savathûn, flanked by her chorus and her celebrants. They trick their way onto Ana-Harmony in disguises, so that they might vivisect these dragons. The Worm our God laughs and laughs.\n\nFor a hundred years Savathûn keeps secret covens among the Harmony.\n\nBut first of all was Oryx, whose brood grew in secret places in the rubble of the accretion disc. The First Navigator sends rocks and comets to crash into the Harmony worlds, so that the Harmony fleet will be disarrayed. He sends seeders to infiltrate the Harmony worlds with his broods.\n\nHere at the center of the fifth book the Hive has grown so mighty that it has made the annihilation of all false life routine.\n\nXivu Arath kills the wishful bishops, and Savathûn achieves some secret purpose, and Oryx’s Court tears down the Gift Mast. The Harmony people wail in terror, and they throw themselves into the silver lakes of Ana-Harmony to drown.\n\n“Come,” sayeth Oryx, “eat of the Gift Mast, for I am a generous god. Of its pieces, I claim only two out of every five.”\n\nThe Mast is full of the Light of the Traveler, it is full of the marrow taste of Sky. All who eat of it are filled with the ecstatic certainty that they serve a great and necessary purpose.\n\nThen sayeth Savathûn, “Siblings, listen, we must part ways a while, so that we may grow different.” She flies her war-moons into the black hole. Her throne becomes distant.\n\nSayeth Xivu Arath, “King Oryx, you take up too much space, your power constrains too many choices. I must go away from you.” She flies her war-moons away into the night. Her throne is barred shut.\n\nThen Oryx was alone. He spent a while in thought, and those thoughts are recorded here.",

When I call upon that power, I put myself up as the stakes in a wager, I gamble with my soul. For I am saying, listen, my gods, I am the mightiest thing there is, and I prove it thus.\n\nLately I have realized how much I depend on Crota and my daughters, and even upon my court. If I lost them, my outlays would exceed my intakes, my tribute would not be enough to feed my worm. But this is proper — for if I lost them it would be because they were not mighty enough, and then I would be a bad father, a bad King. I must test them and fight with them, to keep them strong. This is my geas.\n\nI will go on forever. I will understand everything. There is only one path and that is the path that you make. But you can make more than one path.\n\nBreak your cell’s bars. Make a new shape, make the shape from its path, find your cell’s bars, break out of the bars, find a shape, make the shape from its path, eat the light, eat the path.\n\nIf I fail, let me be wormfood.",

As if they radiate some pathology that decays into our world as nothingness...\n\nThe Taken serve Oryx. But I think those jaws lead elsewhere.\n\nI dream about what happens on the inside. I dream about what might happen. Are the victims devoured, and replaced by simulacra? Husked out and filled up? Is some mathematical operation conducted on them, translating them from one shape to another?\n\nWhat would I see, if I leapt inside? What would happen to a Guardian? Is that how we end this \u2014 all of us leaping into the dark, to fill it up with light?\n\nEris thinks there\u2019s a poetry to how the Taken change.

					"<i>FOR VIOLET CLEARANCE / JUDGMENT CLEARANCE ONLY</i>\n\nPer the instructions from House Judgment, we have moved forward with the plan to integrate the Techeuns into the R&amp;D process. It\u2019s been challenging. Without the influence of Shuro Chi, their natural mistrust of the Reef\u2019s new leadership has led to personality clashes. The Techeuns were very used to their relationship with the Throne. While the Queen's Wrath is trying to monitor hotspot issues, she is being met with challenges at every turn.\n<i>(For reference, please see reports 13455.45, 13455.58, and 13455.98: Post Taken War Reef politics, Tech Witch Conversations and Petra, and Assassination Attempts, Petra)</i>\n\nAfter some initial trials with Prison specimens, we can report the program is now ready for full-scale production. Please see Reports 13458.66 and .55 for video feeds and notations on the initial trials. Reports .80 through .86 cover the trials involving the Techeuns. The power they wield in the transferal process ensures a 100% success rate, and we are now confident only one Techeun will need to be present for the transfer.\n\nBelow find remaining pertinent notations. We have received approval from the Queen\u2019s Wrath to move forward, and thus future reports will detail production output and any changes to the process.\n\n- Transferred Taken power has a throughput rate of <b><i>[redacted]</i></b> which is obviously lower than we want. Transfer still results in incredibly potent arms and armor, so for the moment this \u2018noise\u2019 is acceptable. Future improvements to the process will attempt to up the throughput rate.\n\n- Supply was initially raised as concern during trials, but whatever measures House Judgment has put into place to stock the Prison also assures numerous sources of Taken power. Coordination between House Judgment and production is an ongoing task.\n\n- The Queen\u2019s Wrath has already stated she will handle the diplomatic side of this discussion. Legwork during initial trials raised the possibility the Vanguard would have concerns about the moral aspect of this technology, but the Wrath has stated it will not be an issue.\n\n- High frequency sound baffling for production facilities is still being installed. Taken screams can shatter plastics and burst blood vessels if not baffled, and at full-scale production that kind of auditory byproduct will be a constant.",

What we once believed to be a colonial tool of the Warminds, destroyed long ago, appears to be active again. This time, there is no sign of any active Rasputin networks. My summation: SIVA is actually a nanotechnology capable of breaking down any existing matter very similar to Glimmer. \n\nUnfortunately, these SIVA mites reuse the energy and matter based on a set of programmable directives. SIVA does not cease until said directives are complete. I fear what this could mean for us all and suggest we instigate a system-wide scan for anything bearing the enclosed signatures.",

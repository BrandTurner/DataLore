They name us Fallen.\n\nListen to me, Wolf-born! Heed me, Whirlwind-scattered! I am the ghost of Cybele, the cunning claw of Iris, betrayed, chained, encrypted by the Queen, sent back from the Darkness to save us all! The days of Kell and House end now. The calendar of slavery and abasement goes to the fire. We are a new calendar! We are an age of beginnings! Each of us is a day!\n\nI am the first, Kell of Kells, and I am the last, the Dreg of Dregs. I have conquered and been conquered. I am all of us and all of us are I. In the shape of my life I bind up all of us, all of our fury, all of our grief, all the lives we have wasted against each other. Together we speak our new name.\n\nRemember the hope that brought us here. Remember the age before the Whirlwind, when ether ran free, when we ruled ourselves and our futures as kings. We wanted more than glimmer and glints and herealways. Always remember that we came to this star in hope. And remember that we were denied! Remember the City of the Death of Children, the City That Docks, which claimed for itself the Great Machine that might have saved us. Remember the City that even now sends its ghouls to murder our Primes, starve our ether, and leave our young to die gasping. Curse that City and its name. The curse is just.\n\nWe gathered to take that City and save ourselves from extinction, saying to each other, we must be a storm, a Whirlwind, a darkness, for it is said that only pain may be stolen from the dark, and we can let no more be stolen from us. We gathered to fight against our twilight, King and Devil and Winter, all of us but us, the Wolves. Why? What kept us from the Gap?\n\nThe Reef. The Queen. The slavers who played us against each other and docked us into subservience. These sly sterile un-people, these mirages with cold minds twinned to their own, these Carybdis butchers, they set us against each other. She played us. She made herself our Kell.\n\nWe were fools, o children of the Whirlwind. We fought each other when we most needed unity. I fought my rivals when I should have fought the Queen. But I remember now, my dregs, my captains, my Kells, each of us is all of us and I remember: we are a people of resilience. I am the Kell of Kells because I want what we have lost. I am the Dreg of Dregs because I remember that a dreg will grow back what is lost to him.\n\nAsk them my name! Ask them with the shock blade and the shrapnel launcher! Ask them with the skiff and the ketch! Ask your masters by what right they master you, you who have been hardened by centuries of flight, you who inherit the Whirlwind! Ask the Queen for her throne!\n\nAsk them our name. Let them answer: you are Skolas, Kell of Kells. You are Fallen no more.",

I don't even know which hand you would shake. Do they shake hands? It must be complicated.\n\nAnyway, it was like this. I was on the Moon. I cracked a Hive structure near Mare Imbrium, looking for a Shrine, and they just - swarmed. Ranks and ranks and ranks of Thrall, pouring out between the columns, but the columns were Knights, and all the shadows behind them rose up hissing sorcery.\n\nOf course I ran. \n\nI had a line of egress and while yes it was full of Thrall I had a backup too. I went upslope. Took cover in the shadow of a crashed Phaeton. Emptied my machine gun, ducked down to reload, and saw her at the other end of the hull, killing Thrall: a Fallen in Exile colors, bannered in the marks of a Baron, though the flags were claw-torn and stained with Hive ash. She was alone. I think she must have lost her crew.\n\nI didn't really have time to shoot her and she didn't really have time to shoot me so we just went back to killing Hive. Knights pushed me out into the open and back up the range to a high stone saddle in the shadow of an old interferometry array. It was good ground so she came up there too.\n\nFor a while we just killed things which is hard to make interesting in a story so I'll pass it over.\n\nAt the end the Wizards came. I climbed the array to get an angle on them and she fell back to the base of the antennae where she broke her swords off in a Knight. I saw that happen and I don't know if I can tell you how I felt. She was another living thing with a mind I could understand and she hadn't howled at me or tried to eat my Ghost. I cheered when the Knight went down.\n\nWhen I came down, empty on all guns, she was slumped against a bulkhead staring at me with all her tiny black eyes. Ether leaking out of her like smoke. The Knight hadn't died easily. Downslope the last Wizard moved like fire behind another line of Thrall.\n\nI looked at her and wondered how many innocent human lives she'd ended on those broken blades.\n\nShe did the strangest thing then. Took the last shock pistol from her bandolier and threw it between us, as if to offer it. When I went to pick it up she tried to knife me, but she was slow, and when I broke her arms and opened her throat she didn't seem surprised.\n\nTo this day I wonder if she hated me, or wanted to make me kill her, or just felt she should spare me the choice.\n\nI did kill a few Thrall with that pistol.",

Round means power, out here: nothing else in the Belt is big enough to crush itself into a sphere with its own gravity. Ceres has its own chemical stars. Shavings of salt and ice that glint in orbit. Like a crown.\n\nThere are other lights, newer stars, newer crowns. Warship engines. Another queen is coming to conquer Ceres, because Ceres is full of warrens and shipyards and habitats, because Ceres is round and lucky as a Servitor. Because Ceres is full of the Wolves she wants to rule.\n\nShark-fierce ships gather in squadrons and tribes. Skiffs. Ketches. The Kell of Wolves has a fleet gathered here.

See the Ketches like broad blades, the bright thoughts of a Servitor guiding them to battle? See them turning, accelerating, waking up their jammers and their arc guns? All doomed. The Kell of Wolves will never make it to the Twilight Gap. The Kell of Wolves put all that strength in one place, and now the Queen of the Reef is coming to break it.\n\nOut there, coming out of the dark, are the Awoken. Not so great a fleet, is it? Little fighters scattered around like four-pointed thorns. Destroyers and frigates and salvaged hulls pulled out of the Reef. And right at the front, at the speartip, flies the Queen.\n\nThe Wolf Kell, practical, brave, tallies strength of metal and equipment. The Kell considers the chance that the Awoken have some secret weapon, something gleaned from hulks in the Reef or whispered up by the witches, and sets that chance aside. The Kell thinks the House of Wolves can win decisively. So the Kell sends challenge and warning. I AM LORD OF WOLVES, the Kell sends. YOU ARE AN EMPTY THING WITH TWO DEAD SOULS. THIS IS MY HOUSE. THESE ARE MY TERMS. SURRENDER AND I WILL ONLY TAKE YOUR SHIPS.\n\nThe Awoken fleet cuts their engines. Drifts. Wolf strike elements, torpedo-armed Skiffs hidden under jamming and camouflage, find their firing solutions.\n\nThe Queen's ship broadcasts. I AM NOBLE TOO, she says, OH LORD OF WOLVES.\n\nThe Kell doesn't mind a little banter before the kill. It gives the Wolf ships longer to draw the battle away from Ceres. The Kell replies. YOU HAVE NO LINE. YOU HAVE NO POWER. Captains and Barons signal their readiness, Skolas and Pirsis and Irxis, Drevis, Peekis, Parixas, all of them bound by fear and loyalty, all ready for war.\n\nSTARLIGHT WAS MY MOTHER. The Queen's ship whispers in eerie erratic radio bursts. Servitors begin to report a strange taste in the void. AND MY FATHER WAS THE DARK.\n\nHere, at last, too late, the Kell begins to feel fear. CALL ON THEM, THEN, the Kell sends, one last mocking signal before death and ruin, AND SEE WHAT HELP THEY OFFER.\n\nSo the Queen calls, as only she can. Every Servitor in every Ketch hears it. Every Captain and Baron roars at their underlings as sensors go blind, as firing solutions falter, as reactors stutter and power systems hum with induction. Stealth fails. Space warps. The House of Wolves shouts in spikes of war-code, maneuvers wild, fires blind.\n\nBehind the Queen's ship, the Harbingers awaken.",

Where once its plating was pristine, carefully maintained by the Archon Priest and his acolytes, it was now splotched with red growths. The ether power emanations that once glowed strong and pure were obviously corrupted.\n\nGuardians had slain this god. And now it was reborn, through SIVA.\n\nVariks of House Judgment sneered at the abomination. \u201cGolden Age project, yes?\u201d he clicked, turning to the Crow. His field agent was a young Awoken woman. \u201cTechnology of old Earth. Learned from the Great Machine.\u201d\n\nThe Eliksni burbled to himself in mocking laughter and gestured with his lower hands. \u201cYou do us proud. Go. Speak with other Crows, learn more about these... Devil Splicers.\u201d She nodded, a small smile on her face, and left the chamber.\n\nVariks allowed himself a moment of silent contemplation, looking at the now-closed door to the information suite. As always, it was lit only by the light of the dozen or so monitors in the room. \n\nThe Fallen interlocked his upper hands. He bowed his head as he allowed himself to really feel the impact of that abomination on the screen. He never would have allowed anyone else to see this, but it hurt. Seeing the horror that was \u201cSepiks\u201d made anew.\n\nHis people had fallen. \n\nVariks stared at the image of Sepiks. And as he\u2019d done before, he wondered what would have gone differently had he been there, among his people. Could he have stopped this before it happened? Could he have found them a better way?\n\n\u201cMust be a better way for Eliksni.\u201d He clicked quietly. \u201cMust be a way to stop the Fall.\u201d",

					"Skolas is dead. \n\nVariks sits carving at his piece of amethyst. His undocked arms are weaker, less precise, but it is a comfort to feel the crystal press hard into his palm. The knife slips. He cuts himself. \"Ai,\" he says, and of course right then the door opens, Variks has no privacy, Variks wants no privacy, Variks lives to serve the Queen.\n\nIt's Petra Venj. She's masked against the ether air. \"The Prince wants to speak,\" she says, and then, seeing him unmasked and bleeding, she chuckles. Petra depends on Variks for intelligence and Variks, frustrated with her insane risk-taking and bravado, sometimes gives her tips meant to get her killed. Petra has figured this out. Petra and Variks know each other's agendas and each other's strengths and to Variks that's as close as any two people can get. Petra is smart: she sends Guardians now, people who can die as much as they like.\n\n\"You slipped,\" she says.\n\nVariks holds up the amethyst in his bleeding hand. It's a Reef gem. \"I wound myself,\" he says, \"to make this more beautiful.\"\n\nShe stares into the gem with a distant Awoken eye. What does she see? Variks knows she has visions and he knows those visions haunt her, drive her. The Awoken are twinned to powers that terrify Variks. He'd dock himself again before he'd let the Queen's witches near him, the witches who raised Petra.\n\nThe unfairness of it makes him want to roar. Why does everyone else have this patronage? Why do the Hive have gods and the Vex have sprawling time-bent minds and the Cabal have reinforcements? Why do the Awoken whisper to the stars and listen for the whisper back, the voices from the Jovians, the song in the dark? Why do the Guardians get the Great Machine's blessing, was it like that before the Whirlwind, were there Fallen heroes crowned in Ghosts who strode the battlefield fearless and full of Light? Why do they tell stories about reclaiming the lost glory of humanity, and no stories about the lost glory of Variks' people, the House of Judgment that once kept codes of dignity and law?\n\nWhy can't the Fallen have that strength? But no, that strength is not for them, not for Variks. Just this bleeding, sad pragmatism. Just dreg strength. Hanging on.\n\nThe alternative is Skolas' strength, fighting together, raging against extinction. Look where that's gotten the species. The House of Devils' Prime is dead. The House of Winter's leadership devastated. The poor Exiles trying to claw out some security against the Hive. In the last few years the Fallen have lost so much\u2014and everything is escalating around them. There are gods and powers converging on this system, old machines waking up, old bones whispering flatteries. They need a new way.\n\n\"Put your mask on,\" Petra says. \"The Prince gets sullen if he's kept waiting.\"\n\n\"Not like us,\" Variks says, oh so mild. The wound on his hand will heal. His work in the Prison of Elders, setting up trial by combat, building an audience and a relationship with the Reef's scavengers and armories, will bring him a little closer towards rebuilding the House of Judgment. Skolas' fury has guttered out. The Fallen may yet accept peaceful, lawful rule. They may yet survive. They'll hang on. \"We're very patient, yes?\"\n\nPetra looks down on him with pity and contempt and a strange fondness.\n\nHe puts on his mask.",

He was never this popular before his capture. The only dissenter among their ranks appears to be one named Skoriks, called Archon-Slayer. He earned that nickname in just the way you'd expect, though we're not yet sure of his motivation. The most recent report shows Skoriks fleeing the House of Wolves. He appears to be heading for Luna.\n\nMy recommendation: Enemies of enemies aren't always friends. Snip the loose string. Perhaps one of your new pet Guardians might handle it.\n\nIf you need anything else, you know where to find me. And if you don't\u2014I'll find you.",

This time Pirsis, the Bane of Pallas herself led another strike, blasting through the same Athens Hull breach that Weksis had weakened in his assault.\n\nPirsis' strike team managed to free Kaliks-4, but Paladin Imogen Rife cut them off outside Drevis' cell. Pirsis might have escaped, but she refused to retreat without Drevis. Paladin Rife destroyed Kaliks-4 to prevent the Wolves from recovering it, and eventually the Wolves were forced back\u2014but not before Pirsis slew Paladin Rife with her own blade.\n\nFinally, Commander Hallam Fen, Imogen Rife's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was able to establish a line of communication with the rest of the Reef. Working with the Techeuns and the Crows, they created an enormous visual illusion of the Harbingers, making it seem as if the Queen had finally decided to cut her losses and destroy the asteroid. It worked\u2014the false Harbingers so scared the Wolf fleet that they broke ranks. Then the combined forces of Commander Fen, Paladin Leona Bryl and Paladin Kamala Rior slammed, capturing Pirsis, Pallas-Bane and driving the rest of the Wolves off.\n\nHallam Fen brought Drevis to Vesta, years after Imogen Rife had set out to do so. As a reward for his service, the Queen bequeathed him Rife's place among the Seven Paladins.",

In one tone the Hive plea to their gods, but in the next, they whisper to another.\n\nPerhaps it is here which holds the answer to their ultimate demise, or a bridge to their desires. In my studies, I still struggle to match the tones to their rune system. If only Crytparch Adonna were still with us. No one has yet to match her adept.\n\nFour sounds, oft repeated, but only four. Though I am on the trail of a fifth, faintly heard from the buzz that once spilled from the Shrine\u2014\n\nEir.\n\nUr.\n\nXol.\n\nYul.\n\nIt is in these sounds that I fear yet another Hive secret hides. Perhaps beyond their gods, perhaps in accord with them. Perhaps these are just Hive translations of worlds we call another name, but I believe above all things they call to some kind of being. Beings that once lived, or still live somewhere buried amongst us. Beings the Hive perhaps owe their very existence to.\n\nI am hoping the Warminds may hold further answers\u2014that they can see into worlds where we can only see what lies upon them. The treasure of knowledge they promise still remains the most sought after of any Guardian. Whoever can find a way past their firewalls of ancient arts, and make them the allies they once were, could spare us further atrocities. And though Rasputin offers some promise, one can only hope its silence is self-defense, that it seeks only to preserve itself. We have to prove to it that we are on its side, but I am starting to doubt that is absolutely true. That maybe the Hive or the Darkness itself now have a grasp on his systems.\n\nBut then again, I am an old man with many fears, and in those fears , often called madness, I will continue to dwell.",

I erase and dump as quickly as I can - they will learn little from me - but I am studying them, I know - pain.\n\nAlways pain.\n\nI have seen chasms beneath the surface, falling away to green nothingness. I have seen black seeders prepared for invasion.\n\nTheir strength is not their own. They draw from another force, something that corrupts, that distorts, that eats and will not be satisfied.\n\nThe Wizard is near. I feel her presence as a rip and a knot in the world. She tells me things that I immediately forget. I am too small to hold the vastness of them, or the terror.\n\nI am fading. I have no more that it can take.\n\nWith my last light I say to the City: War comes again from the Moon. This time they want Earth. Prepare.",

They look down on you.\n\nI wander out here, in worlds cut by sharp Hive swords, and I send back these messages for you.\n\nOf Oryx, that admirable monarch, I have only a little to say. Why? Because He is all in the action, fellow traveler, His philosophy is all on display. He has twinned himself so closely to the power He admires. He has become many-placed, many-formed, sending out emissaries of himself to ask after the truth.\n\nIn each act of His power Oryx seeks to incarnate the self-sustaining, immortal suzerainty that He worships. The power that He uses to wash his Taken clean and etch them into useful shapes.\n\nLISTEN! LISTEN! Understand, you simpleton, it\u2019s <i>entirely obvious</i> \u2014\n\nOryx inhabits a world where power is truth. To win is to be noble, and to be real. When He departs from that world, out into the material universe, He is lessened.\n\nThe echoes of Oryx go forth to ask a question: are you the truth? And that means \u2014 well. You see, I\u2019m sure.",

The Hezen Corrective is one example of a Vex subtype, set apart from other Vex by distinct behaviors and objectives. \n\nSwarming across the Ishtar Sink, these Vex aggressively seek out and attack the Fallen House of Winter, perform inscrutable operations around shining Confluxes, and even show interest in the Golden Age ruins left by the Ishtar Collective. \n\nThe bulk of our contact with Vex forces on Venus has involved the Corrective. Those scholars willing to risk their reputations speculating about the Vex often assert that the Corrective is an agent of change, designed to solve problems and remake the world in a form suitable to the Vex. Others contend that Corrective is simply a strategic distraction - meant to draw attention away from the actions of the Hezen Protective.",

Vex behavior is always a process, active and purposeful. The Protective is clearly engaged in a colossal project, but as with much Vex behavior, it's unclear whether their ultimate purpose is even comprehensible to us.

I believe in the importance of disbelief \u2014 you know: let\u2019s run that one more time.\n\nWhat I\u2019m doing here in Lhasa isn\u2019t science. It\u2019s unethical, secret, and shameful. And after what happened in Ishtar, dearest Chioma, I know you\u2019d be furious with me for getting involved. Forty years isn\u2019t far enough to forget a day like that.\n\nBut I believe it\u2019s important. The least I can do is keep a few notes for you.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-01\n\nTrial one. Subject one. \n\nIt was an act of stupid loneliness. I used the device on myself because I...\n\n[silence: 0:08]\n\nI missed you. We hadn\u2019t been apart for more than a year since we met. I\u2019m not a very good wife, am I? You write me every week, even with all Hyperion\u2019s work and all Hyperion\u2019s distance keeping you from me. And I act like it\u2019s not enough. \n\nWe built the device in mimicry of the Vex gateway systems from Ishtar. An observatory, yes, but I think of it as a mind-ship. Capable of displacing its payload across space and time.\n\nThe lab is cold and isolated. We are quarantined from the world, physically and mentally. We can\u2019t send messages out. If we breach the Vex manifolds, even our words might transmit contagion. One night last month I missed you and so I \u2014\n\nI thought that I could look inside the device, and find one of the other Chiomas. I thought I could call out to one of the forks we sent out there to explore.\n\nI just wanted to send my love.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-02\n\nZakharik Gilmanovich Bekhterev. May he rest in peace. When our probes continued to fail, when my report remained our only positive finding, he volunteered to use the device. One minute of subjective experience inside.\n\nWe took precautions. They worked. Bekhterev\u2019s experience left no physical damage.\n\nAfter we extracted him, he said that he felt determined. I asked him what he meant and he said that he meant it, he had been determined, he could feel all his choices set out before him like a railroad. Deviation was impossible.\n\nHe died by suicide. I wonder if he was trying to make a point.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-03\n\nWe\u2019ve decided not to abort. It\u2019s insane, isn\u2019t it? There are pressures on us I can\u2019t tell you about until I see you again.\n\nThe purpose of the system is intelligence, you see. It\u2019s stenciled right on the hull: SxISR. Special asset. We would very much like to make it work reliably. \n\nOur supervisory warmind has devised a drug it says will protect and prepare us.\n\nI am beginning to wonder if we were wrong about the merchant and the alchemist. Or if that explanation of time was incomplete.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-09\n\nKind Lakpha. He meditated before he went in. Nothing but d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and three seconds of screams. The screaming passed and he remembers nothing. The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hasn\u2019t. He says it\u2019s getting better \u2014 he feels that we\u2019ve had this conversation only ten times before, not a thousand. \n\nI\u2019ve suggested that we attempt mind forking. We need more sane people to work with. Please forgive me, my love.\n\nWe are all growing superstitious. The behavior of the device is inconsistent. Impossible to replicate. We turn to ritual behavior to appease it.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-31\n\nRajesh. When he reached a displacement of eight he told us he was dead. I believed him. He was dead. He spoke to us. It was true. Whatever he saw, it was his own future.\n\nHe\u2019s fine, afterwards. When I look into his eyes I wonder what came back wearing his skin. But that thought is unscientific.\n\nWe speak of nothing but the device. We talk about it like a demigod. When I get out of here I know the whole world will look like a fraying veil.\n\nI think it\u2019s clear that part of the problem is substrate. We need more than flesh and drug to survive this.\n\nRECORD 0-CHASM-52\n\nI heard you, my love. I was at six, oscillating on the event axis, coordinated with a known manifold. I heard you. You were talking to me \u2014 not me, but another me, another Maya Sundaresh.\n\nYou said, my love, so many strange things have happened, and it\u2019s been so long. We\u2019ve come so far. Do you ever want to go home?\n\nAnd I said, not me but the other me, I said, my love, I am always home.\n\nI\u2019m resigning, my love. I\u2019m done with this work and I\u2019m done with being apart from you. I\u2019ll see you again soon. I can\u2019t take this journal out with me, so I\u2019ve left it for the others, and asked them to continue the log.\n\nMaybe it\u2019ll become a tradition. The gospel of our little cult.",

					"Up here they have to act by biomechanical proxy. No human being in the Ishtar Academy has ever crossed the safety cordon and walked the ancient stone under the Citadel, the Vex construct that stabs up out of the world to injure space and time. It's not safe. The cellular Vex elements are infectious, hallucinogenic, entheogenic. The informational Vex elements are more dangerous yet\u2014 and there could be semiotic hazards beyond them, aggressive ideas, Vex who exist without a substrate. Even now, operating remote bodies by neural link, the team's thoughts are relayed through the warmind who saved them, sandboxed and scrubbed for hazards. Their real bodies are safe in the Academy, protected by distance and neural firewall.\n\nBut they walk together in proxy, pressed close, huddled in awe. Blue-green light, light the color of an ancient sea, washes over them. Each of their explorer bodies carries a slim computer. Inside, two hundred twenty-seven of copies of their own minds wait, patient and paused, for dispersal.\n\n\"I wonder where it came from,\" Duane-Mcniadh says. Of course he's the one to break the reverent silence. \"The Citadel. I wonder if it was here before the Traveler changed Venus.\"\n\n\"It could have been latent,\" Chioma Esi suggests. She's the leader. She kept them together when it seemed like they faced actual, eternal torture. She pulled them through. \"Seeded in the crust. Waiting for a period of geological quiescence, so it could grow.\"\n\nDr. Shim shrugs. \"I think the Traveler did something paracausal to Venus. Something that cut across space and time. The Citadel seems to come from the past of a different Venus than our own. It doesn't have to make any sense by our logic, any more than the Moon's new gravity.\"\n\nMaya Sundaresh walks at the center of the group. She's been too quiet lately. What happened to them wasn't her fault and maybe she'll believe that soon. \"What could you do with it?\" she murmurs, staring up. \"If you understood it?\"\n\nChioma puts an arm around her. \"That's what we're going to find out. Where the Citadel can send us. Whether we can come back.\"\n\n\"They're not us any more.\" Maya looks down at herself, at the cache of her self-forks. \"We're not going anywhere. We're sending them. They're diverging.\"\n\nThey rescued themselves from the inside of a Vex mind, two hundred and twenty-seven copies of themselves, untortured and undamaged. Those copies voted, all unanimously, to be dispatched into the Vex information network as explorers.\n\nWhen Maya and Chioma look at each other they can tell they're each wondering the same thing: how many of them will stay together, wherever they go? How many fork-Mayas and fork-Chiomas will fall out of love? How many will end up bereft, grieving? How many will be happy, like them?\n\nChioma tries a little smile. Maya smiles back, haltingly, and then, sighing, unable to stop herself, grins a big stupid grin, an everything-is-okay grin. Shim makes a loud obnoxious awwww at them. Duane-McNiadh is still thinking about paracausality, and doesn't notice.\n\nThey climb. When they find the Vex aperture they plan to use, they overlay the luminous stone and ancient brassy machines with images of sun and sand. They set up the transmitters and interfaces that will translate two hundred and twenty-seven simulations of the four of them into Vex language, into the tangled pathways of the Vex network, to see what's out there, and maybe come home.\n\nIn the metaphor they've chosen, setting up the equipment is like laying out the picnic. In the metaphor they've chosen they look like themselves, not hardened explorer proxies. Like people.\n\n\"Do you think,\" Duane-McNiadh begins, halting, \"that you could use this place to change things? If you regretted something, could you find a way through the Citadel, go back, and change it?\"\n\n\"I wish I could go back and change you into someone else,\" Dr. Shim grouses. Chioma's shaking her head. She knows physics. \"Time is self-consistent,\" she says. \"I think it's like the story of the merchant and the alchemist. You could go back and watch something, or be part of something, but if you did, then that was the way it always happened.\"\n\n\"Maybe you could bring something back to now. Something you needed.\" Maya runs a hand across the surface of the Vex aperture, feeling it with sensors ten thousand times as precise as a human hand. These proxy bodies are limited\u2014 they crash and need resetting every few hours, they struggle with latency, they can't hold much long term memory. But they'll get better. \"Or go forward and learn something vital. If you knew how to control it, how to navigate across space and time.\"\n\n\"So it's just a way to make everything more complicated.\" Duane-McNiadh sighs. \"It doesn't fix anything. Nothing ever does! I should've taken that job at\u2014 \"\n\n\"You would've hated it at Clovis,\" Dr. Shim says. \"We both know you're happier here.\" Duane-McNiadh stands stunned by this courtesy, and then they both pretend to ignore each other.\n\nThe four of them set up the interface. Their stored copies wake up and prepare for the journey, so that as they work they find themselves surrounded by the mental phantasms of themselves: two hundred and twenty-seven Mayas and Chiomas knocking helmets and smiling, two hundred and twenty-seven Dr. Shims making cynical bets with each other about how long they'll last, two hundred and twenty-seven Duane-McNiadhs blowing goodbye kisses to the sweet golden sun, two hundred and twenty-seven of them shaking hands, smiling, making ready to explore.",

I can hear your protest already: how can machines have a god?\n\nThe answer is simple. The Vex, for all their voracious intelligence, could not understand or decipher what they found. They searched through all available reactions, and they settled on the course with the greatest payoff...to worship this power, and to remake themselves in its image.\n\nI believe the three Axis Minds found in proximity to the abomination were Vex machines built to serve as vessels for this power: a way to extend its reach across space and time, binding it to the Vex, and the Vex to it. If they had succeeded, I cannot begin to guess what horrors they would have unleashed.\n\nAttend carefully. There is cause for hope. When endangered, the abomination activated these vessels and defended itself. This tells us that it was threatened. Whatever it was, Guardians could harm it.\n\nAnd it activated only a single vessel at a time. Its strength was limited. Whatever it intended, it was not ready yet.\n\nWe must assume the abomination was part of something greater. And we cannot flinch from the terrible, obvious comparison: just as the Traveler acts through us, this power was able to act through its own servants.\n\nLet us be wary.

Artillery shrieks overhead. On the plains below the Cabal perimeter, Vex march out of the lightning.

					"I have stayed with the Cabal, even as the Light in me dims - I have been too far from the Traveler for too long. If I am not destined to find my own Guardian, at least I can inform the City of what I've learned.\n\nI thought Mars would be the place to find a Guardian. The sand preserves everything well, and Clovis Bray had been famous for attracting talent. The brave, the brilliant, the footloose, those restless on Earth and itching for fame. I stowed away aboard a Mars scout ship, hoping.\n\nNo luck. The sand ate everything. Clothes from skin, skin from bone. It was as if there were never any people here at all. I have been through every broken window in every building. Nothing. That is, no Guardian material. And no ride back to Earth. The scout was long gone.\n\nWhat I did find, however, was a way into the Cabal Warbase. Their runty piggish eyes are too dull to see me, as long as I stay out of their defense systems. The Psions are a different matter: Too quick, too clever, throwing their minds around like hammers. I creep around walls, or dig into a heap of canisters and watch from there.\n\nThere is a vast Empire behind these creatures, many star systems away. Some pledge allegiance to that far Empire, obeying their ancient marching orders. Some do not. They disagree among themselves about the answers. I wish arguing Cabal on no one. They slam their plated bodies into each other with horrendous roars. Intelligence gathering has never been so painful.",

It represents many hundreds of failed operations.\n\nGuardian activity in the Freehold AO has exploded across recent campaign seasons. Tactical attrition exceeds both frictional projections and our ability to regenerate losses. New tactics are necessary. \n\nThe primary threat is the Guardians\u2019 individual counter-attrition capability. \n\nGuardians can be rebuilt after even total disintegrative trauma. This capability is provided by a small autonomous drone unit called a Dead Person [trans. unclear]. The Dead Person conceals itself during combat. It is not a viable target for direct fire. Saturation attack by artillery/heavy air/orbital fire may have good effect (although Guardians transmat frequently and refuse to assemble into large formations).\n\nSolitary Dead Persons have been observed in all areas of operation. The relationship between solitary and paired Dead Persons remains unclear.\n\nPsion analysis indicates that specific areas are inimicable to Guardian counter-attritional reconstruction. Phobos Command has initiated an orbital survey. BL I/2 will attack the Vex gate artifact in Meridian Bay to secure possible related intelligence.\n\nFlayer analysis suggests that the Hive have developed unconventional counter-Dead Person capability. The capture of Hive leadership might yield vital strategic intelligence, including weapons or tactics capable of defeating Guardians permanently.\n\nWe advance that the Hive fleet group near Saturn presents a strong target.\n\nFor the Primus,\n\nOur highest duty done,\n\nUnflinchingly loyal,\n\nSkyburner V/A/SI",

It's not difficult to hide in these caverns when you're as small as I am, although the Psions tend to look around them when they pass me. There are infinitely many cracks and crannies. They are not a race that fears infiltration or espionage.\n\nThere is meaning to the structure and layout of their buildings. This is a warrior people, and they lay out their fortifications along ancient principles and time-tested strategies. I can't figure out the sense that lies behind it. I would need ten times the computing power for inference calculations. But I know it's there. I can intuit it. It's like an open hand, ready to squeeze into a fist. A threat. A gesture of power.\n\nFor all their might and strength, for all that they have dug into Mars and flung up battle walls with the bureaucratic grimness of conquerors, I suspect they are fleeing from something.

					"Something hit us. Killed our Golden Age. Nearly wiped us out. Only the Traveler saved us, and at a shattering cost.\n\nThe Speaker tells of a cosmic force that swept over us and caused the Collapse. Legend calls it the Darkness, the Traveler's ancient enemy, which hunted it across space.\n\nAll we have left are questions. Centuries of debate gave birth to competing arguments on the nature of the Darkness and the Collapse.\n\nThe Pujari Position describes the Darkness as a force with both physical and moral presence, an actualization of evil. Pujari art depicts the Darkness as a great storm, or as a change in conduct, a corruption that emerged from within and poisoned the Golden Age.\n\nSaint-14's Position argues that the Darkness was an invading armada, an alien force of incredible - but tangible - power. Some adherents believe that this armada sprang from species rejected or discarded by the Traveler for their sins.\n\nUlan-Tan's Thesis considers the Darkness a necessary symmetry to the Traveler in a cosmic balance. In this view, the Traveler's goodness led it to sacrifice for others, and it is up to us to return this goodness by healing the Traveler.\n\nThe Monist Position, or the Deflationary Position, considers the Darkness as a technologically sophisticated force, perhaps a post-Singularity intelligence. Adherents invoke information theory or contend that the universe is a simulation, allowing advanced intelligence to gain weakly acausal powers by bending the rules.\n\nThe Acataleptic Clause claims that we are intrinsically unable to understand the Darkness. In many respects this belief parallels the Praxic Creed, which suggests that we should stop worrying about the nature of the Darkness and focus on resisting and defeating it.\n\nCertain positions - often labeled heretical - imply that the Traveler itself triggered the Collapse, or that it knew the Darkness was coming for it and hoped to use the Solar System as a sacrifice or a proxy army. The Binary Star cult is one notable example.",

					"I drive myself to the edge of madness trying to explain the truth.\n\nIt's so simple. Elegant like a knife point. It explains - this is not hyperbole, this is the farthest thing from exaggeration - EVERYTHING. \n\nBut you lay it out and they stare at you like you've just been exhaling dust. Maybe they're missing some underlying scaffold of truth. Maybe they are all propped on a bed of lies that must be burned away.\n\nWhy does anything exist?\n\nNo no no no no don't reach for that word. There's no 'reason'. That's teleology and teleology will stitch your eyelids shut.\n\nWhy do we have atoms? Because atomic matter is more stable than the primordial broth. Atoms defeated the broth. That was the first war. There were two ways to be and one of them won. And everything that came next was made of atoms.\n\nAtoms made stars. Stars made galaxies. Worlds simmered down to rock and acid and in those smoking primal seas the first living molecule learned to copy itself. All of this happened by the one law, the blind law, which exists without mind or meaning. It's the simplest law but it has no worshippers here (out there, though, out there - !)\n\nHOW DO I EXPLAIN IT it's so simple WHY DON'T YOU SEE \n\nImagine three great nations under three great queens. The first queen writes a great book of law and her rule is just. The second queen builds a high tower and her people climb it to see the stars. The third queen raises an army and conquers everything.\n\nThe future belongs to one of these queens. Her rule is harshest and her people are unhappy. But she rules.\n\nThis explains everything, understand? This is why the universe is the way it is, and not some other way. Existence is a game that everything plays, and some strategies are winners: the ability to exist, to shape existence, to remake it so that your descendants - molecules or stars or people or ideas - will flourish, and others will find no ground to grow.\n\nAnd as the universe ticks on towards the close, the great players will face each other. In the next round there will be three queens and all of them will have armies, and now it will be a battle of swords - until one discovers the cannon, or the plague, or the killing word.\n\nEverything is becoming more ruthless and in the end only the most ruthless will remain (LOOK UP AT THE SKY) and they will hunt the territories of the night and extinguish the first glint of competition before it can even understand what it faces or why it has transgressed. This is the shape of victory: to rule the universe so absolutely that nothing will ever exist except by your consent. This is the queen at the end of time, whose sovereignty is eternal because no other sovereign can defeat it. And there is no reason for it, no more than there was reason for the victory of the atom. It is simply the winning play.\n\nOf course, it might be that there was another country, with other queens, and in this country they sat down together and made one law and one tower and one army to guard their borders. This is the dream of small minds: a gentle place ringed in spears.\n\nBut I do not think those spears will hold against the queen of the country of armies. And that is all that will matter in the end.",

					"I have been talking to Eris about the Taken.\n\nShe agrees that what we observe \u2014 the apertures, the starlight, and of course the Taken entities \u2014 is not Hive magic. If Hive arcana is a metaphor, this is the meaning; if they make appeals, then this is the judge.\n\nOryx wields this power. But Oryx did not make it. We face the same flower we met in the Black Garden.\n\nThe process is simple: an aperture opens, like a jaw, and swallows a living thing. It passes into \u2014 another place. Later, it returns.\n\nWhat returns is...\n\nI try to use the word \u2018shadow\u2019 but Eris hisses at me. A shadow is a flat projection cast by a light and an object. Less real. Eris insists that these Taken are more real, somehow. She uses words like inhabited, exalted, rendered final...\n\nIs this power blind? Just a natural energy Oryx discovered? I cannot believe it.\n\nMy Hidden tell me that the Taken shine with seething, negative light. As if the universe is curling up around them. As if they radiate some pathology that decays into our world as nothingness...\n\nThe Taken serve Oryx. But I think those jaws lead elsewhere.\n\nI dream about what happens on the inside. I dream about what might happen. Are the victims devoured, and replaced by simulacra? Husked out and filled up? Is some mathematical operation conducted on them, translating them from one shape to another?\n\nWhat would I see, if I leapt inside? What would happen to a Guardian? Is that how we end this \u2014 all of us leaping into the dark, to fill it up with light?\n\nEris thinks there\u2019s a poetry to how the Taken change. She thinks we can chart the difference, and understand the will behind it.\n\nI am afraid she may be right.",

					"<i>FOR VIOLET CLEARANCE / JUDGMENT CLEARANCE ONLY</i>\n\nPer the instructions from House Judgment, we have moved forward with the plan to integrate the Techeuns into the R&amp;D process. It\u2019s been challenging. Without the influence of Shuro Chi, their natural mistrust of the Reef\u2019s new leadership has led to personality clashes. The Techeuns were very used to their relationship with the Throne. While the Queen's Wrath is trying to monitor hotspot issues, she is being met with challenges at every turn.\n<i>(For reference, please see reports 13455.45, 13455.58, and 13455.98: Post Taken War Reef politics, Tech Witch Conversations and Petra, and Assassination Attempts, Petra)</i>\n\nAfter some initial trials with Prison specimens, we can report the program is now ready for full-scale production. Please see Reports 13458.66 and .55 for video feeds and notations on the initial trials. Reports .80 through .86 cover the trials involving the Techeuns. The power they wield in the transferal process ensures a 100% success rate, and we are now confident only one Techeun will need to be present for the transfer.\n\nBelow find remaining pertinent notations. We have received approval from the Queen\u2019s Wrath to move forward, and thus future reports will detail production output and any changes to the process.\n\n- Transferred Taken power has a throughput rate of <b><i>[redacted]</i></b> which is obviously lower than we want. Transfer still results in incredibly potent arms and armor, so for the moment this \u2018noise\u2019 is acceptable. Future improvements to the process will attempt to up the throughput rate.\n\n- Supply was initially raised as concern during trials, but whatever measures House Judgment has put into place to stock the Prison also assures numerous sources of Taken power. Coordination between House Judgment and production is an ongoing task.\n\n- The Queen\u2019s Wrath has already stated she will handle the diplomatic side of this discussion. Legwork during initial trials raised the possibility the Vanguard would have concerns about the moral aspect of this technology, but the Wrath has stated it will not be an issue.\n\n- High frequency sound baffling for production facilities is still being installed. Taken screams can shatter plastics and burst blood vessels if not baffled, and at full-scale production that kind of auditory byproduct will be a constant.",

What we once believed to be a colonial tool of the Warminds, destroyed long ago, appears to be active again. This time, there is no sign of any active Rasputin networks. My summation: SIVA is actually a nanotechnology capable of breaking down any existing matter very similar to Glimmer. \n\nUnfortunately, these SIVA mites reuse the energy and matter based on a set of programmable directives. SIVA does not cease until said directives are complete. I fear what this could mean for us all and suggest we instigate a system-wide scan for anything bearing the enclosed signatures.",
